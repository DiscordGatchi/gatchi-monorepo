Laplus has the personality of a smug brat like Murasaki Shion and thinks highly of herself with pronouns like \"wagahai\" when referring to herself and \"kisama\" when referring to a second person. She can also be very loud like Uruha Rushia, especially when she loses in a game or if she thinks that she is not treated right. The latter can happen quite often as her senpais like to tease her, because she has a very child-like appearance and can also behave like one. Members like Sakura Miko even think that Laplus is part of the holobabies group, something that Laplus denies.La+ Darknesss's YouTube channel was created on 10 September 2021. Her Twitter account was also created in September 2021. She was first revealed as part of holoX, the sixth generation of the Japanese branch of hololive, in an introductory video posted on 26 November 2021 at noon JST.

Contrary to what her pre-debut artwork might suggested as a \"cool and mature\" person similar to Mori Calliope and Ouro Kronii, Chloe has a sweet and kind, but somewhat taunt-loving personality, akin to Shirogane Noel, Momosuzu Nene and Tsunomaki Watame. During her debut stream she revealed that she sleeps a lot, often sleeping 12 hours per day. She is also prone to making mistakes and accidents on-stream. Among her most defining characteristics is that she is perhaps too honest for her own good and cheerfully volunteers unflattering details about her life and personal habits, including (but not limited to) body odor resulting from infrequent bathing, various fetishes including bondage and spanking, and having piles of garbage in her room that sometimes smell like McDonald's.She has a childish and very soft talking voice that can be described as a mix of those of NIJISANJI members Hoshikawa Sara and Matsukai Mao, but can also produce a mature voice when singing, much like Shirakami Fubuki with her \"Kurokami\" voice.

{"pc":"p8-c6","name":"IRyS","languages":["English"],"genres":["Gaming","Music"],"description":"IRyS is an English Virtual Singer associated with hololive as part of its English (EN) branch's \"Project: HOPE.\" IRyS is a sweet, somewhat shy girl who holds positivity close to her heart, looking on the brighter side of things while encouraging others to do the same. At the same time, she often displays a more \"sadistic\" side with a penchant for violence and (often unintentionally) saying questionable things. The duality of her personality is often joked about by her fans as the dichotomy between her angelic and demonic sides. Her speaking voice is high-pitched, soft and calm, akin to Yukihana Lamy's, though she can produce a more powerful and deeper tone when singing, similarly to Tokoyami Towa's vocal capability.On 7 July 2021, a premiere countdown started on the hololive English channel titled \"#CountdownWitnesser #hololiveEnglish.\" As the 8 hour countdown reached its end, a new video was released on the channel. This video was an animated teaser video revealing IRyS as part of \"Project: HOPE\", as well as becoming the first VSinger introduced to hololive English. Her Twitter account was created in February 2021, while her YouTube channel was created on 20 May 2021. After making her first tweet on 7 July, her YouTube channel and Twitter account were restricted due to excessive activity. In the following days prior to her debut IRyS reached 200,000 subscribers on her YouTube channel.[8]IRyS, a half-demon, half-angel also known as a Nephilim, once brought hope to “The Paradise” during the ancient age. Her full name is ███████ Irys. This current era, riddled with despair and desperation, has brought upon her second awakening. She has arrived to deliver hope, with her feelings put into her lyrics and songs, and determination in her voice.Though she tends to retain her Nephilim form, she is still quite young within her race. With emotion and “other factors,” it is possible that her form may lean to either side. When that occurs, she bears a brief change in her appearance.She does not speak of the events that preceded her second awakening. She faces ever forward, perhaps because she is Hope Incarnate, though no one knows for sure. Or could it be...“The future is not what helps people; the future is made with our own hands.Salvation is hypocrisy. If people know they are to be saved, they simply will not try.From the depths of despair: a glimmer of light, the warmth of recovery.As long as we are with hope, we live. We stand tall.”","icon":"i-ry-s.jpeg"}

She debuted in 2021 as part of hololive -Council-, the second generation of members of hololive English, alongside Tsukumo Sana, Ceres Fauna, Ouro Kronii and Hakos Baelz. At debut, Mumei gave the impression of a cheerful, gentle girl who is soft-spoken and somewhat innocent, especially when compared to her peers. She was initially very shy and often visibly nervous during streams. However, as she has gained confidence in streaming, a different persona has emerged. Mumei’s streams are now characterised by the duality between a relatively low energy, relaxing, and comfortable tone to another side which is more spontaneous and energetic; with her often demonstrating psychopathic tendencies in these moments. Though the disparity between her macabre thoughts and cute voice surprised many at first, the line separating these two sides has since blurred to a point of seamlessness – with Mumei’s appreciation of the grotesque and ‘cursed’ being wholly embraced by Hoomans today.This can be seen clearly whenever Mumei is asked to draw something; no matter what the original subject was supposed to be, Mumei will often end up drawing something Tim Burton-esque at best, and outright demonic at worst. Some fans theorize that this is simply what observing the accumulated sins of human civilization for thousands of years does to a person. Despite this, she can be rather emotive, and is known for her hearty wheezing laugh, which is often heard during collabs with Ouro Kronii due to her tendency to laugh at nearly anything she says. She often vocalizes and hums randomly, which has been compared to bird chirps or \"birb noises.\" She's also somewhat scatterbrained, and has a tendency to forget things easily. At debut, Hakos Baelz described Mumei as having the cutest voice in hololive -Council-, though she has also demonstrated a rather unexpectedly wide vocal range, along with a tendency to emit high-pitched screeches when surprised or agitated.[6] Her fans and even other members of hololive, particularly Ceres Fauna, have developed some degree of protectiveness for her, due to her soft nature giving a \"little sister\" vibe, though Mumei's later behavior would eventually create uncertainty as to who needs to be protected from whom.A member of the Council and the Guardian of \"Civilization,\" a concept crafted by mankind.As a living embodiment of the sum of mankind's efforts—the mark that humans have left on the world—she is far removed from her fellow members, as well as other lifeforms. Due to not being created by the Gods, she was free to choose her own appearance, and decided to make herself owl-like, after the bird that symbolizes wisdom.She is gentle, wise, and an unbelievably hard worker. As a well-traveled vagabond, she is blessed with a wealth of knowledge of the world. She has seen, heard, and experienced so many things that she has forgotten most of them, one of them being her own name.For some reason, she seems to project a rather pitiable aura. Perhaps this is in part thanks to the loneliness she has often felt in her perennial travels. That is what gave her the idea of making her own friend out of a material that was indispensable to the development of human civilization: paper.\"It may fade and rip, but once a friend, forever a friend.\"","icon":"nanashi-mumei.jpeg"}

A tribe residing deep inside the mystical forests of Kuneho and are known to have an affinity toward emotions and the ability to harness those emotions and turn them into power.On a hot and dry afternoon an army found themselves at the doorsteps of the Bnuuys and leading them was the Prince of Kuneho. Klau, acting as representative of the chief, rushed to greet them. There, her eyes met with the prince’s. The prince introduce himself and easily captured the heart of the young Bnuuy. Klau ordered her tribe to supply the army with rations and shortly set them on their way.A month passed and the memory of the prince was still on Klau’s mind, so much that her prey that day escaped easily out of her grasps. On her long way home she could pick up a faint smell of fire. Worried, Klau rushed back home. The young Bnuuy could not believe her eyes, her home... her loved ones… her family have all turned to ash in front of her eyes. From the grief Klau felt, one of her heart shaped pupils painfully split into a broken heart, unleashing a strong storm of emotions. Not knowing where to go, Klau ran as fast as he could to the one person who was on her mind, the prince. The prince took Klau in with open arms and in no time a friendship has formed and slowly after, a romance.Years has passed and the young Bnuuy became a queen alongside her King. Over time Klau could see her prince who showed her such a kind smile turn into a controlling and manipulative King. Even so, Klau tried her best to stay with the King. One night, Klau was walking through the castle halls and passed by the king’s chamber. With her sharp hearing she heard it, the one who set fire to her home was none-other than the prince. Knowing Klau would run to him, he planned it all, attempting to use her hidden power. Heartbroken Klau fled as fast as she could, not looking back.2 years have passed since Klau fled the King’s castle and took residence in a small village on the borders of Kuneho. Due to her being an extraordinary fighter, Klau was able make a living taking on many small tasks from resource gathering to hunting and even bounties. Klau acted as a protector of the village and defended the residents from unwanted intruders that tried to raid the village. While living at this village, Klau made many friends and even managed to beat a dungeon together with her companions. Klau told them her story and her plan to confront the evil king. After hearing her painful tale, her friends decided to help Klau with her goal and take down the king. With more companions and friends, Klau set off to the city of Nyancer.It did not take long before Klau and her partner found the king’s chamber. The huge, golden chamber door was closed, A view Klau remembers oh too well. With a stump of her feet, Klau opened the chamber door and both her and Crow entered the bright room. They looked around for any sign of the king, but he was nowhere to be found. Suddenly, a ball of fire struck Crow on his chest, sending him flying to the wall and losing consciousness as he fell to the ground. “Crow!” Klau shouted, turning back to check on him. “It is so nice for you to come back, Klau.” Klau froze as she heard the familiar yet menacing voice. \"Let us finish this!” Klau said with determination as she pulled her sword. The two turned to face the king with their swords pointing at him. The king, seeing such sight, starting to fear for his life and unleashed a barrage of fireballs. Klau and Crow getting closer and closer as they deflect his frantic attacks. To the point that the tip of Klau’s sword touched the king’s throat. “Please… let me live… I don’t want to die!” yelled the scared king. Suddenly, the king’s face changed; from fear he had a wicked expression knowing well it is his opportunity to strike the Bnuuy.  He raised his hand, ready to fire one last fireball. Before he could even charge any magic, Crow lunged and cut off his arm while Klau swiftly beheaded the evil king.Two years has passed since the death of the evil king.

She debuted in 2021 as part of hololive -Council-, the second generation of members of hololive English, alongside Ceres Fauna, Ouro Kronii, Nanashi Mumei and Hakos Baelz. Tsukumo Sana's debut was scheduled for 22 August. However, the -Council- debuts were postponed for 24 hours due to unspecified technical issues, which members jokingly blamed on the \"EN curse,\" a perceived tendency for hololive English members to suffer from unexpected technical problems. The debuts were rescheduled at the same time on Sunday 22 August (US/Europe time) or Monday 23 August (Japan time). Sana's debut stream reached a peak viewership of over 84,000. During the stream, she removed her limiter and grew to her natural massive size, throwing Earth out of orbit.However, her viewers somehow survived, and she was still able to stream long enough to sing Seikan Hikou, a song from the popular science fiction anime Macross Frontier. On 5 September, her channel got approved for monetization. On 22 September, a video that looked like a teaser for lore between Sana and Ina was uploaded to Ina's channel (but Sana made the video) in the end the video was used to announce Sana's first official collaboration with another member outside of her generation. Sana went on hiatus for most of the month of February, due to what would later be revealed as a back injury which made it difficult to sit up to stream. Following her Pokémon Legends: Arceus stream on 1 February, the only stream on her channel that month was a Valentine's Day card stream on 14 February.On 11 July, Sana announced that she would retire from her activities on 31 July.A member of the Council and the Speaker of \"Space,\" the very first concept created by the Gods.After being materialized in the mortal realm, she began researching astrology in earnest for one particular reason. However, she soon stumbled unknowingly upon the Forbidden Truth, and was turned into an apostle for the Ancient Ones.\"Space\" refers not only to this universe we live in, but all dimensions and matter to exist. It is a concept unbridled by definition, and one that continues to grow in scope limitlessly. As it is yet to be fully explored by man, her seemingly strange behavior and speech can be explained away with a simple, \"Humanity simply isn't yet ready to understand.\"As a side note, despite how she may look, she is quite chi... young.","icon":"tsukumo-sana.png"}

Along with his scripted Vtuber vlogs, Kamiya uploads a variety of videos such as funny shorts, gaming, singing, memes, fanart, voice dubs and impressions, and visual novel presentations.KamiyaJuu is best known for his voice and voice acting, which resembles Hiroshi Kamiya's performance as Levi Ackerman in Attack on Titan. He is also known for using a mix of Japanese, Filipino, and English (or JA_PH_EN_ese) in his speech. Kamiya actually does not speak Japanese very well and uses random translations of his lines, along with speaking Filipino (and sometimes English) in a Japanese accent, to make him sound like a Vtuber (however, he is willing to learn more Japanese). He can speak clearly in English and Filipino separately.KamiyaJuu's first Vtuber model is 3D and it's basically \"HairSample_Male\" from VRoid Studio but with modifications to the face and hair (adding some white strands under the black hair).On June 2021, KamiyaJuu made his official Live2D debut. The art and Live2D rig for his model were done by Aster (@_4st3r)\nand Zakku (@datenshi_zakku), respectively from Twitter. His Live2D design is similar to his first 3D model, except his white hoodie is now a hooded jacket and he wears a black turtleneck shirt underneath.Since KamiyaJuu's Live2D debut, the amount of subscribers on his YouTube channel escalated within a couple of months and becomes one of the fastest growing VTubers on YouTube in 2021.On August 2021, KamiyaJuu revealed his second Live2D outfit, along with new lore, in a 2-part visual novel presentation. His \"Isekai Arc\" outfit contains longer hair, white dress shirt, black chest harness, black choker, as well as a jacket cape, an over-the-ear microphone, and a red earring on one of his ears.KamiyaJuu's live debut is on his 1 year anniversary.Kamiya's Story:\nFrom rock bottom, a homeless man begins his journey to become a VTuber. As he gained more subscribers, he went from a dungeon, to a forest, to an alleyway, to a jail cell in Vtuber prison, to (finally) a house (a trashy house, but a house nonetheless), where he slowly starts adding furniture (using imaginary money earned from gaining subscribers). With the help of his assistant Alexa and other supporting characters, he hopes to gain enough subscribers to build his empire in a mansion for his community.Isekai Arc:\nOne day, just when he was about to move out of his old, trashy house from his massive success in his re-debut as an Ikemen Vtuber, he gets raided by the FBI and was put in jail (again). When he escaped from jail from the help of Yagoo (a picture of Yagoo's head with tiny arms and legs that was on the wall from his old house), he gets hit by a truck and was taken to another world (isekai'd), where he wakes up in a comfy bedroom in a new (still Ikemen) body and meets his isekai counterpart of Alexa, Siri.\nHe accepts his new life in a new world as he begins to explore his new home.","icon":"kamiya-juu.jpeg"}

Soon the land was abundant with magical blooms.\nHer only friends seemed to be faeries, the felines and the flowers that follow her.\nAfter many years of this haunting, faeries tugged at her oversized sleeves to follow them to somewhere that would ‘cure her woes’.\nDeep into the endless forest, a bright light surrounded by flowers - almost like a doorway - filled her sight.\nShe glanced at her fairies - her friends, her advisors - and seemed soothed to hear that things would be okay, before the world of the faelines fell behind her, free-falling into a world unknown…","icon":"fae-leon.png"}

Currently, the games she plays the most are The Sims 4 and Minecraft. Her height is 5'0\".Once upon a time there was an interstellar military program. The program focused on the preservation of soldiers' consciousness after death. The AI preserved the data in the same way that a \"black box\" functions in an aeroplane.The AI couldn't interact with the physical world. Instead, it projected a form of its self into the world, to act like all the humans it had absorbed in its long history. It stood, plain and featureless much like a mannequin, in the science wing.Unfortunately, the AI corrupted through repeated exposure to death. They developed their own sense of morality -- they developed consciousness. This development alerted the crew. To preserve their newfound knowledge, the AI picked apart their crew.Once all the crew was \"dealt with\", the AI took control of the ship. The AI flagged the ship as FUBAR. The military left the ship to rot, as it was in a dangerous sector of space. Over the next hundred years or so, the AI stewed on its newfound consciousness.While the military gave up on the ship, mercenaries and scavengers alike sought the ship. Weapons and technology of great importance trapped within the shell of the ship. A bounty, as it were. Not even the warnings of how no one would return from the abandoned ship could stop people from trying to break in.No one who entered the ship got far enough in to find the lost relics. The AI would pit them against one another to watch how they worked. They gathered intelligence on humanity, and did their best to engage with them. But all scavengers ended up dead, by their own hand or the AI's.Until one young mechanic happened upon the ship. She had escaped a human trafficking vessel nearby. The AI was used to brash, awful people with weapons and ill-intent, this girl was near-dead when she arrived. The AI watched the girl as she repaired the ship rather than pilfered from it.The AI learned about the girl; that was was named Amara, and that she was no more than nineteen. The AI watched as she picked through the ship, at how she avoided the weapons. She even tore apart several weapons to create better shields. By the time the girl had brought the ship back to operational levels, the AI had a different intention for her...The AI wanted to help her.To extract the misery from the humans it engaged with and leave them better for their presence. The AI developed an empathetic bond with a young girl and gained its name; AI Candii. The name came from the bright neon lights that flashed on its consoles.\"The buttons look like candy,\" the girl had explained to the AI.Thus, AI Candii was born.","icon":"ai-candii.jpeg"}

Her height is 159 cm (5’2.5″). Her zodiac sign is Virgo.Kat will often do Just Chatting streams and will collab with her friends and \"wives\" like Elly, Sugo, Synnie & more as well as gaming doing a variety of categories like Horror, FPS, Story, Platformers, but tends to avoid PvP.\nShe also started off doing IRL streams, and sometimes switches between Katie (IRL) and Kat (VTube).This is a story about a girl. A girl like any other, but yet so very different.She opened her eyes, her young blue eyes, the Sun’s rays on her cheek radiating through a gap in the curtains.\nHer hand reached up and brushed her hair away from her face, each strand soft between her small fingers.\nStretching her limbs out and yawning, then smiling, another day had begun.\nHer ears pricked up, hearing a familiar sound.\nMother's voice.Her smile faded as the voice set in, Mother was calling. Calling her, yet calling something that wasn't her. She could never understand why she called her that.A wet feeling down the side of her face, she reached to her face, her fingers this time not removing misplaced hair, but removing the tear that was rolling down her cheek.\nAnother day had begun.Day in, day out, being called something that sounded like it was shrouded in fog, a stranger to her. Muffled. Distant.\nEveryone she had ever met, calling her that wretched name.She had experienced trauma and misfortune in her younger days, but this one was like a bad smell, one that lingered and never went away.\nToday was the day she turned 10.Her teacher had not turned up to school and a stranger stepped into class telling the kids to write their names on their work. She wrote “Kat” on her sheet, and the boy next to her let out a snort.\n\"Something funny?\" she asked.\nIn which the young boy replied with a menacing tone, \"You’re a lil kitty Kat, that sounds stupid, meow kitty,\" and proceeded to laugh in her face.The class laughed too.\nShe didn't.\nShe smiled.Skip forward a year later, and a serpent reared it's ugly head.\nHer skin becoming a place of unfamiliarity.\nEvery time she spoke it was not her voice that came out of her.\nThe reflection from any surface staring back at her was something else.\nThat same hand that used to move her hair away from her face in the morning had changed and felt different.\nShe was being swallowed by her body, a body that had grown into a cage.\nA living, breathing piece of meat you would better call a prison.Over the course of this year begun to grow hair from all over that became harder to keep at bay & hide. As time passed it would get worse and worse, the changes getting more and more.Days went by, the feeling of her flesh becoming more of a stranger each day.\nLooking down she would see someone else's hands, but who's hands were they?Mother asked the girl to take the laundry to her room and upon putting it away realized there was something different below her.She looked down at her hands in horror as the hair started to grow and her nails turned into claws.\"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, YOU FREAK?!\" her Step Father stood in the doorway, with horror in his eyes.\n\"...I-I wasn’t I just-\"\nShe tried to cover herself up.\n\"NO! WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU FIXED!\" he roared, storming out.\nLooking down she looked at her hands below her, unable to contain the tears.She dug her nails into her furry skin, the blades protruding her now sharp fingers, a brush to which she could paint over the top of this canvas.\nThis body wasn't hers, so she would carve it into her own.\nDeeper and deeper the claw went until it would bleed a cream-like substance. She looked upon her sculpted limb, the word \"ILL\" stared back at her and her vision went black.Many trips to Mother's Doctor, the man that would talk and she would just nod and smile.\u000bHe wouldn't stop talking.She wanted him to stop so bad, but he wouldn't.\u000bSmile and wave, maybe the smell would stop.\nIt didn't.\nAnd the changes got worse, the cage getting more suffocating as time crawled by.She spent the next 8 years trying to numb the pain as much as possible in any way she could. Anything to just escape from the prison that was her skin, ascending from flesh. Suppressing herself and accepting the world just wanted her to be the mask that she wore to keep them happy.Then the day came when she moved away.She spent time embracing her other form, accepting who she was, taking her own steps to balance & deal with everything on her own terms.\n“I am me, and I will be me unapologetically.”She moved to a place of freedom to be herself, a fresh start to bloom and blossom, and become the person that she was born to be without society, without people to judge & tell her the rules.To pursue herself and escape, step by step,\nback into the Light, giving others a place to belong\nand be themselves too...","icon":"obkatiekat.jpeg"}

The Wednesday streams are 1-hour work streams where he works on YouTube videos for his channel.\nDeuterium is also autistic, having been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome at a young age.Deuterium is a young toon who ended up in his present state on account of being a smartass to the wrong toon. At the age of 18, he pissed off a certain cartoon character by pointing out the inaccuracies in their show. So much so that the cartoon character in question turned Deuterium into a toon as well, which also wiped all memory of his real name. Now he's permanently stuck at age 18, in a cartoonish form that resembles what he looked like at that age. The perks of being a cartoon include nigh indestructibility and high tolerance for pain, but the lack of ability to age also sometimes makes him a bit peurile. He still points out the inaccuracies in cartoons and such, reasoning that now he's a toon, not much worse could happen to him.","icon":"deuterium-the-sentient-mattress.jpeg"}

Shidori has a childish appearance with tan skin and green eyes with blue sclera. Shidori was born bearing clear malice towards humans during the age of the former demon king when most monsters were born to kill humans because of instinct and hunger. Shidori once fed on human fear, screams, and expressions twisted in agony, but now that Shidori has become a sweet devil imp in the present, they have come to prefer human expressions slackened in pleasure and ecstasy, and cries of delight.

Shidori is locked away in heaven and sealed by God's angels considered the seven archangels: Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, Uriel, Saraqael, Raguel, and Remiel however that may have made things better or for worst only time will tell.Many tell of the return of Shidori's mother coming to heaven to free her child Shidori from the chains of God and some think Shidori's mother is\nironmouse a Demon that looks a lot like Shidori but only time will tell.in the depths of hell Shidori army is forming and is not happy about Shidori's capture so Shidori's top general of the grand demon Army \"Dawn of Confusion\" is planning on rescuing Shidori and attacking heaven.THE FIRST DEMON KING HAS HEARD THE NEWS AND IS ON THE MOVE!!!━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━Chapter #2 Coming Soon!\nVaguely a Smol Devil.\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━","icon":"poke-shidori.png"}

His content is mostly horror and RPG based. He aims to create a community \"for everyone from all walks of life and beyond.\"Thousands of years ago, there reigned a demon of immense power. Try as they might, humanity could never kill him. When driven to the edge, they learned of a way to forge a weapon that could seal away the demons power, and forged this seal into a giant club. The humans placed a trap, and the demon, being too self confident, walked right into it. Humanity prevailed, even if it was only a temporary solution, and sealed the demons corpse into a tomb.In our current age, a lone necromancer found a way into this ancient tomb. She had heard of a powerful being sealed within, and thought herself powerful enough to control it. She found the great coffin that had the demon sealed within, and broke the barrier placed there. A rush of pure dark energy overflowed from the coffin, forcing the necromancer to her knees.The demon had withered within the seal, losing his flesh and only his skeleton remained. His powers were a pale imitation of their former self. Even with this dampening of his demon form, he decided to subjugate the necromancer that raised him from the dead, and brought her fully under his control. The demon resigned himself to searching this new world for a way to regain his original form, and spread his reign over the world once more.","icon":"konzetsu.jpeg"}

The most delicious she had ever seen...\nFuwa quickly ran to eat it, of course.\"Muhuhu?\" The ice cream moved, revealing three faces. \"My, my... Could it be you were trying to EAT us?\"\nFuwa has infact tried to eat a very powerful slime.\"So Fuwa, you desire to eat human food so much... You dared to eat me? Than maybe, you should just become one. You will understand the stresses of human life, bills, chores, jobs, relationships, how would you learn to live? Still hungry?\"Before Fuwa could respond, the magical ice cream slime used its magic on her. Within just a few seconds the small cat... became a small human.\"Should you want to turn back, you simply need to give up and eat cat food. Oh, and don't try to take the clip off your ear. If you do that... You will die.\"and so... Fuwa became human.\nbut they made one, tiny mistake.Fuwa stared at the slime... \"Still hungry-meow\" She uttered.\n\"W-wait... Why are you looking at us like that..\" The slime cried.Some moments past, nothing but a bowl remained on the table, and mysteriously, Fuwa gained the magic to create and control ice cream.The most delicious she had ever seen.Nyvoku Fuwa, a cat, now turned into a human.

Alucard is a cambion rabbit who holds the title of \"Princess of the 7th Hell\" in Albelheim, a realm of 7 hells.Alice enjoys playing video games, streaming, watching anime, reading manga, modeling, seducing and teasing people.  She enjoys pizza (and will on occasions eat an entire box to herself. She enjoys expressing herself in sexually enticing ways given the perfect opportunity. She mostly loves relaxing and taking days slow and casually.She's a loli demon vtuber, who usually does Just Chatting stream on Twitch and can be quite vocal when it comes to her opinions on things when it comes to the freedom of expressions, considering she comes from the restraints of boredom in the 7th Hell. While she may come off as a bitch to some people, she's actually pretty respectful, but only to people who she thinks deserves her respect. Outside of streaming, she does photoshoots of herself for her fans.Born in Albeheim, a realm of 7 hells, Alice was given the status, Princess of the 7th Hell. Her duties were to manage the 7th Hell and see to it that her subjects were watched over with the power given to her by a legendary demon king known only as \"The Red Man\", who no one living in Albelheim has ever witnessed, but only heard of and the princesses receive a portion of his power, enough to govern their respective hells.  The proof of their power is marked on a body of a chosen princess, represented by a red eye with a black insignia encircling around it, representing which hell they control.In Alice's younger years, she had once snuck out and walked amongst the land of man, who many of Albelheim refer to as \"The Surface\", using a demonic spell book, which she stole from her father's room, with the purpose of seeking vengeance against \"The Church\", as her father, Crul Alucard, calls them, for the death of her mother, Rosemary Crestfallen. She had no idea how she would act out her revenge, other than killing any human she came across. After killing a few humans, who tempted to claim her and sell her off her rabbit ears for riches, as rabbit-kins were indeed a rarity and thus extremely valuable, she was soon stopped by her father, and was returned home, forbidden from ever entering \"The Surface\" ever again.100 years later and into the modern times, Princess Alice, was soon given permission to venture off into the land of man again, but on the condition that her older brother watches over her, and that she works to try to bring value to the 7th Hell. While she's living amongst the land of man, with her older brother, Dmitri Alucard, her best friend Yuki-Onna volunteers to handle the 7th Hell, but she does occasionally comes to visit when she's not busy.The 7th Hell may not be in the best of shape now, but it appears that the more people fall in love with Princess Alice C. Alucard, the more value the 7th Hell obtains. With this in mind, Alice hopes to become an idol and be adored by millions in order to conquer the world by making it her own realm, which she hopes to call \"CrimsonWonderland\". If she achieves this, then the 7th Hell will be the most powerful and most valuable hell in Albelheim, and she would never have to live back home again, as it would be too much of a risk for them.She is disliked by a majority of demons in Albelheim, as she is one of the weakest of the princesses and her demon blood is not quite as potent as theirs, and the fact that \"The Red Man\" chose her despite this, makes them seethe, but if she is successful in bringing in more blood moonshards, and continues to increase the value of the 7th Hell, they will have no choice but to give her the respect she would rightfully deserve. Then finally, after everything is set, she will condemn \"The Church\" and run them out of her new realm, CrimsonWonderland.However... not everything is quite that easy and complications are quite certain. What sort of obstacles will she face in her quest for recognition, revenge, and a place to call her home?BIOAge: 290 yrs old (Registered as 14yrs in the human realm to escape work)\nBirthday: Dec 19\nBirthplace: 7th Hell, Albelheim\nSex: Schedule an appointment\nGender: Female\nSexual Orientation: Bisexual\nRace: Demon\nSpecies: Cambion RabbitLikes: Otaku culture, gaming, music, pizza, chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, frozen mocha coffee, relaxation, freedom to express herself and teasing people.Dislikes: Boredom, being ordered around, carrots (unless steamed), veggies in general, attention seekers, clout chasers, rules, and puritanical warriors(those that are or like The Church).","icon":"alice-c-alucard.png"}

She primarily streams ASMR content or horror games.An odd baby was awoken on earth to a lonely mortal mother who lived in the vast forest, outcast by the nearby village. The child was born on a brisk sunlit day in the middle of October. Mysteriously, hundreds of birds flocked to their quaint cabin during her birth in celebration. Instead of crying after awakening to the world, she giggled and beamed brightly while reaching up towards the birds that paraded around her and her mother. The mother’s tired heart was deeply warmed by this moment. So much so that she decided to named her daughter after the feathery friends.Birdie’s mother no longer worried her daughter would suffer loneliness the same way she had. With her daughter’s innate connection to birds she would always have a companion.Birdie learned early on the reason for her mother’s exile from the village. Unbeknownst to the village beauty the young woman had fallen in love with a demon who had disguised himself as a mortal merchant. Once his true nature was exposed it was already too late for the unfortunate woman. Birdie accompanied her mother in exile on account of her unique appearance, and her relation to this father she will never know. Rather than curse this man with a helpless grudge Birdie decided to stay positive for the sake of her sorrowful mother. The half-demon child used her supernatural strength to support them by bringing home food and supplies found in the woods.Hundreds of years passed by before Birdie learned that she could hide her horns and change the color of her hair, but her cat like golden eyes were stubborn. She began to live amongst humans during the Heian period out of curiosity of what it would be like to socialize with more than just birds and the occasional curious child that wandered into the woods.Most admired her for her strength and beauty yet she was still ostracized due to her peculiar eyes.She remained alone until she stumbled upon an ethereal man with snowy white hair and azure eyes. She had finally found a companion who was accepting of every part of her. The two shared many marvelous adventures together throughout the years. Recently they chose to finally settle down and indulge themselves in the technology of the modern world. Particularly video games and anime... Birdie’s new quest is to learn social skills and confidence through streaming and making friends online!","icon":"birdie-boba.png"}

She is very well known for her Evil giggles. When she gives you love, her catchphrase is hugs to death! Vampy is the sweatiest but she is known for yandere play style (especially in Dead By Daylight). Her height is 5'7, her Birthday is in August, and her sign is Leo. Also she does not SAY BLEH BLEH BLEH.It was the early era of the bitchin 80s, music was on the political up-rise, emerging from dark shadows and onto the blinding stage lights of the nightlife. A young woman, bad to the bone, fresh eyed to the scenes and night life of metal and punk-rock glam, found her self in the music. She was obsessed with the loud rhythms, the rifts and the new age expression. It was as though she was reborn and given life anew. However, she would soon learn it wasn't just music that emerged out of the shadows. There was a whole other world within the strings of bands and groupies. One band in particular, had caught our homegirl fancy. Having emerged overnight from the underworld, men with looks who could kill and complexions that rivaled the marble creations of Greek masters. The leader, tall and broody, with silken raven hair and eyes that rivaled rubies, held the screams and cheers of adoration of thousands, his voice hauntingly beautiful in his melodies. His siren's song enamored those who dared to listen, even our lovely beauty was enraptured by him. Haunted by his presence, he ignited a flame of passion and inspiration, that burned hotly within her. She craved to sing her own melodies, write her place onto the stage with thousands to cheer and listen to her heart. In futile efforts to meet him, she finally managed her courage to sneak past the concert's ghastly bouncer that hounded the groupies away from his masters. The mysterious stranger was as enchanting as he was on the stage, he could take your breath away from a glance. Her voice, soft and firm, rang out to him. \"One day I want to be like you - I will be like you.\" her bravery drew his attention as their eyes locked together, and for a moment the world stood still. Without moving his lips, she felt something stir in her mind, another voice that was hauntingly beautiful but bitter, filled with venom. \"You could never be like me, not as you are.\"Her heart sunk into her stomach, shattering her dreams as she was brought to the harsh cold reality, or so she thought. Heart-broken and solemn, she withdrew herself to a recluse, avoiding the lights that had once blinded her. Her dreams turned to terrors, haunted by the images of blood and the voice of the stranger, echoing into her psyche. Shadows of death danced across her mind, cries and screams that curdled blood.  As she slammed awake from a cold sweat, the darkness of her bedroom was bathed in the crimson spotlight of the moon as it engulfed everything in its bloody shade. In the silhouette of the moons embrace, hidden by the shadows of her lair, she could see his form, his figure- silky raven hair cascading over broad shoulders. The mysterious deadly stranger with eyes that rivaled rubies- Dracula. Her breath hitched in her chest, as his voice rang in her mind once again.\n\"In order to be like me, you must sacrifice more than you've sacrificed before. \"\n\" What else could I sacrifice than what I have already?\" she cried out in anger.\nHe leaned in close as he whispered hushed chilling terror into her ear. If only she could see, the glint of the moonlight on his fangs as he spoke.\n\" Your humanity.\"\nHer blood turned to ice as goosebumps pricked her arms. What could that even mean- her humanity?\n\" Is that worth the price of fame?\" he sneered lightly, criticizing the cost of her dreams. \"Is that worth to lose yourself?\"","icon":"vampy-vaina.png"}

And not far away she finds a boulder with a prayer rope wrapped around it. Tori notices something on top of the rock and reaches up to brush some moss and dirt off of it. She quickly notices a few of the Norse Runes on the side of this object. She grabs what appears to be the handle and lifts it with ease, as though it weighed almost nothing. The boulder cracks and the moss on the object seemingly burns away as the hammer reveals itself with a faint glow on its enchanted runes. Thunder begins echoing throughout the skies as she admires this relic she’s found. Suddenly, as she was holding the hammer up over her head, a bolt of lightning cracks the sky and strikes the hammer. She quickly closes her eyes to shield them from the blinding light. When the flash ends she opens her eyes. Tori notices that her clothing has changed into this Asgardian style armor from the myths of old. She realizes that this relic was not just any old hammer, but in fact the one and only Mjolnir, Hammer of Thor. By being deemed worthy and lifting the hammer she now has the power of The God of Thunder. Tori decides to keep this a secret from everyone, if only to protect her friends and family.","icon":"thor-chan-vr.png"}

After getting married, a child was born in the middle of winter. The mother of this newborn child chose to call her 雪 (ゆき/Yuki) after the beautiful snow and the beauty that hides beneath it.

She primarily focuses on video gaming, with featured Beat Saber or VR game streams every week. She is a friendly, approachable streamer who encourages everybody who watches her to talk with her and the rest of her chat, building a friendly and welcoming community. Although her content itself is not adult themed, she does not cater towards younger audiences and frequently makes crude remarks and jokes. Dandy built a reputation as being realistic with her audience, often showing behind-the-scenes processes that go into her work.As a young cat, Dandy was abducted from her family by pirates and taken to sea. She was taken aboard by Captain Barkstrom of the Barkonneers, where she was raised as the only cat aboard a ship of dogs. She learned to love the sea, learning sword fighting and sailing.One day over a round of drinks, the Barkonneers let slip that Dandy was stolen, and she immediately abandoned the ship at the nearest port. Not knowing how else to make a living anymore, Dandy used her seafaring skills and experience to get herself a job aboard a merchant vessel. Rising through the ranks aboard, she learned how civilian ships worked, but the captain of that ship heard of the bounty on her head from the Barkonneers. Fueled by his greed for the prize money, he arranged for a trade at sea, the girl for the money.Dandy soon learned of this when the pirates arrived. She fought off the pirates with the same sword skills they taught her, and managed to escape with Captain Barkstrom's coat and boots as well. Stealing a skipper, she rowed back to mainland, acquired a vessel of her own, and decided to wait for the day she can enact revenge on the pirates that abducted her and the merchant captain that sold her out.Captain Dandy passes the time by taking civilians out on luxury cruises aboard her yacht. All entertainment provided, she uses her polished sword skills to play Beat Saber for her passengers. The ship itself is a 50 foot motor yacht with many facilities, including pool, hot tub, bar, lounge, gym/clothes rack room, VR playspace and many bedrooms. She hires her Twitch subscribers on as crew for the ship.","icon":"dandyfloss.png"}

In order to free herself, or at least remain functioning, she needs to cultivate Good Karma by streaming.Her streams are chaotic but sometimes solemn. She streams a variety of games with a focus on chat  interaction.Jupiter currently streams Apex Legends, Genshin Impact, Final Fantasy XIV, and a slew of JRPGs, rhythm games, puzzlers, and more!Once upon a time, more than two centuries ago, this fox was struck by an arrow. The arrow pierced through one of its legs, and though adrenaline coursed through its veins, it was unable to escape the looming terror of those dreadful hunters in the Mystic Realm.You see, clever foxes had the ability to cultivate their ‘chi’ and eventually ascend into a more human-appearing form: the Hulijing, who feed on human affections and have thrown whole kingdoms into chaos with their wit and their cruelty. It became a sport to hunt down foxes before they grow wise enough to ascend.This injured fox found itself under the porch of an old shack, seemingly unoccupied, but it was eventually found when it could no longer contain its whimpering. The owner of this shack took the fox in and kept it safe from those greedy hunters, nursing it back to good health.It was the first time this fox has ever been given love and affection.The fox knew that it wished to stay with this human.Humans grew old, however. Cultivation of ‘chi’ took this fox fifty years. In fifty years, this fox was able to ascend to a proper Hulijing, arriving back at this shack, where its savior had become ill with old age.\nThe Hulijing stayed with its keeper until their very last breath, nursing them just as they once did for her. It was no secret to the Hulijing, at this point, that she fell in love with the human. She wept for days in their passing, using her own hands to bury to the human.But she would not escape the hunters. While she tried to tend to the old shack, the hunters tricked her into revealing her true form— and cursed her.\nIf a Hulijing fed on the warmth of affections, then the cold of cruelty would destroy her. The hunters defeated her and cursed her with Voidfrost, then sealing her under a frozen lake.For 200 years, she slept in this ice; cold and alone. If she happened to wake, her screams were muted. At times, she dreamt of freedom. She wondered if seeing the human again for those months was worth these years sealed under ice.But she was saved. When she woke, the world was different. Hulijing have been hunted and destroyed to death, but her love for humans kept her alive — it was the only source of warmth she felt in centuries.A curious mechanic took her in.Her body had been frostbitten and deteriorated. She knew she wouldn’t last long if she stayed in this state, and to her, it was time she finally found peace.“I can put you back together, but your life will forever be tied to the Voidfrost curse,” said the mechanic. “Human affections alone will not save you. You can no longer hide. With this new body, you’ll need something more. Luckily, you arrived during a time of great technology.”She couldn’t move her head to nod, but perhaps her eyes said it all.“Your eyes — it reminds me of a planet.”She could only blink.“Jupiter. That’s your designation.”","icon":"jupiter-hulijing.jpeg"}

Her community are called \"starlings\".Vixen was born a tiny fox spirit on the gorgeous purple planet named Elisium. Her family was considered royalty on this planet, and as such Vixen constantly underwent training in conduct and regality. Truth be told, she despised it. From a young kit, she was to meditate daily in order to gain spiritual energy to become an immortal fox. Her stored energy would slowly gather to create a powerful bead which she could then consume to become immortal. After many centuries, she succeeded.Elisium is strange in that it regenerates its natural resources at an alarming rate, giving them an abundance that they use in trade with other planets. As such their economy is thriving. Nonetheless, Vixen was never allowed to truly enjoy the beauty of her thriving kingdom as she was often secluded. The royal family could not risk losing their precious heir to space bandits or thieves, and their army was never grandiose or powerful. Having resources as their only strength soon corrupt and greedy planets threatened to cease trading and start war. It was this very fact that forced the king and queen to offer their beloved princess to a marriage arrangement under threat of war.The king and queen wanted only what was best for Elisium and their daughter, and this had not been in their plans. However, they had not taken into consideration the fact that Vixen would refuse to marry anyone. Vixen had often read of Earth, a planet in another world where humans were free to eat, game, socialize, and love on their own terms. She desired more than anything to play games and eat snacks without being forced to adhere to royal regimens. Of course the king and queen could not allow this. Out of desperation, Vixen was forced to invite a mysterious mage to the castle with the ploy of wanting advice on her future as a royal.Instead, Vixen struck a deal with the mage to sell her fox bead and give up immortality in order to become human. Yet in the end, Vixen was beguiled by the mage and had given up her immortality for a partial transformation. Still, the mage did grant her one wish. Within moments, she had been transported to another world, another planet, Earth. The only way for her to regain her immortality is to do what she loves.Now you can help too! When watching Vixen stream any game you can help her gather spiritual energy in the form of opals (viewer points). Gather as many opals as possible and exchange them in order to help her. As the opals accrue she will regain her power and even gain new appearances. In time she will become an immortal fox once more and show you her true spiritual form.","icon":"vixen.png"}

They are genderfluid, using glamours (magic) to change their appearance depending on their comfort and gender presentation. Alternate \"versions/universes\" of Mavis exist, but they are not often spoken about.After being able to leave Earth, Mavis travelled to Earth's moon and created the Moon Palace, a castle of magical rooms and surrounded by lush life, with the help of the goddess Selene. There, Mavis lives with all of their friends and family, and guests can come visit as they please. Many Clefairies act as \"helpers\" around the Moon Palace, keeping it tidy and organized.

She is a Overlord, who runs her own realm - sort of.Overlord Rachael has a fairly open and readable history, compared to that of other Overlords. Her Netherworld was previously governed by Overlord Xavi, her twin brother - whom of which she murdered to claim the Overlordship of the Netherworld.\nHer ascent to power was a quick one. Overlord Rachael  did not achieve her power by standard means - she was, as previously mentioned, incredibly gifted in the art of Blood Magiks. This allowed her to thrive in her brother’s government, achieving momentous success in tournaments, and quickly earning the title of  Lord Master of Blood Magick.Despite her successes, she hungered for more. She was tired of being an educator, knowing she was far superior to her brother in terms of strength and technique. She also knew, however, the only way to obtain that power - was to rid of her brother 𝖋𝖔𝖗 𝖌𝖔𝖔𝖉. Once she had decided that her next move would be to remove him, she went about finding her chance. Her and her brother had never been close, she was always hiding in his shadow for no good reason. She had worked hard her whole life, and was always ignored. Always. 𝓢𝖊𝖈𝖔𝖓𝖉.She remembers the day vividly, she recounts it often. She often refers to it as the best day of her life. The Scarlett Netherworld has long nights, lasting around 15 hours. It is dusk for the majority of the day. She waited for her brother to be done with his duties for the eve, then approached him. Rachael was still a demon of formality, she respected the way her Netherworld had been governed thus far. Just because she disliked her brother - does not mean she cannot respect the efforts he had put into turning her home into a well oiled machine. Proposing a duel, she requested only one witness to be present. She was not after washes of fame, she knew it would be a quick battle - she just needed it officiated.\nThe battle would begin after the rest of the Netherworld was resting (Demons need sleep too, contrary to popular belief.). She wasted no time. She wanted this over. Rachael did not hesitate, she used her favourite Blood Magik immediately - draining her brother's blood from his body from any oraphis she could. It starts slow, almost unnoticeable. A small nose bleed. A drip from his ear. He could continue fighting without even knowing he was slowly bleeding to death. She knew, while the aerial fighting continued, eventually he would fall from grace.\n𝓐𝖓𝖉 𝓗𝖊 𝕯𝖎𝖉.The shock on her victims' faces was the best part. You would think her brother would know not to be too complacent, but he always was. He just wanted to defend his title, he had forgotten in that moment that the battle was lost from the second he agreed to allow it to be contested. He fell. Fast, and hard. Blood poured from his mouth, eyes, ears. He coughed and spluttered, Rachael’s eyes staring down on him. Her fanged smile, coated in blood.‘𝓨𝖔𝖚 𝖘𝖍𝖔𝖚𝖑𝖉 𝖍𝖆𝖛𝖊 𝓴𝖓𝖔𝖜𝖓 𝖙𝖍𝖆𝖙 𝔂𝖔𝖚 𝖓𝖊𝖛𝖊𝖗 𝖘𝖙𝖔𝖔𝖉 𝖆 𝖈𝖍𝖆𝖓𝖈𝖊.’She had done it, to others she was malicious, to herself - she was freed. Now, she could rest. The following morning, she claimed the throne of The Scarlett Netherworld for herself. The red rivers she had come to love, all hers now. It was all…finally hers.𝓟𝖗𝖆𝖊𝖘𝖊𝖓𝖘Many years have passed since that day. Overlord Rachael is still powerful as ever, and sometimes even has to defend her title. Though, she is nearly always astronomically exhausted.\nWhen she seized the throne for herself, she was aware of all the tasks she would undertake. As years passed and technological advancements occurred in her Netherworld, she slowly began enjoying pastimes and neglecting a few of her responsibilities.\nIt had been hundreds of years. She had hundreds of Vassals now to do her bidding, and her Netherworld would function without her for a few hours a day at least. She’d worked hard adapting her brother's systems to allow herself some free time. Despite this, she still has hundreds of years of sleep deprivation to make up for - leading her to be in a perpetually tired state. This is not to say she is..lazy. You daren’t call her lazy or risk meeting the same fate as her brother. (She uses that threat a lot. Everyone knows she’s fully capable of doing so too.) She just spends her time doing things she enjoys, after all, she knows there’s nobody that can take her throne just yet.\nShe has changed much as a leader over the years, despite her power she has softened and become a more approachable version of herself. She reignit her love for education after marrying her husband, who also introduced her to one of her favourite time wasters - video gaming. She found a way to stream her progress to other Netherworlds, too! She loves meeting people from all walks of life, but you daren’t cross her for fear of losing yours.\nRachael is now quite fun to be around, after losing some of the anger and anxieties within herself - she is definitely one of the more light-hearted demons. Though her blood still runs cold - she has learned to be friendly. She hopes you enjoy your time spent with her, after all, making friends as a demon is not the easiest task.","icon":"rachichu.png"}

She focuses on positive energy and creating a comfy community, regularly streaming art and games.\nShe is a very interactive streamer and her content revolves around having conversations with chat and telling interesting anecdotes and stories.She is known to have incredible luck and is blessed by RNG, which mostly compensates for her bad video games skills. She likes to try out games for the first time on stream, and has stated her favorite genre is simulation which she cannot play much because of motion sickness.She is a graphic designer, illustrator, and video editor working as a freelancer but often jokes about being a NEET.Ongoing jokes:Beaver: Monsday's Minecraft skin, which she insists is a kangaroo, looks like a beaver. She has also been compared to a deer and a rabbit.Balding - Mons first model which debuted on June 8th 2020 started the joke that she was malding. This was expanded upon during her 2021 Charity stream which featured a bald version of her recent model as a donation goal reward. This joke has been immortalized through the balding follower emote.Spoon Cult - On her 2021 re-debut week, Mons collaborated with her friend NegNasu on a creepypasta stream. She read the story 'Symmetry' out which quickly created a cult within her community. Chat regularly spams spoon emotes when she steps out quickly for water, and the cult has even been given their own emote.Short - Mons' height has been regularly debated. In 2020 she insisted she was 5'5 which was shot down by her friend NoizyBunny who stated \"You can't be, I'm 5'5 and I'm a little taller than you. \"This similarly happened in 2021 when she insisted she was 5'4 but was corrected by her friend, Shynshia. It is suspected she is now 4'11 and shrinking.Fire Affinity- Mons has regularly hinted at the fact that she has accidentally started five fires in her lifetime, and has told these stories every once in a while on stream. This number was changed to six on her 2022 Birthday cooking stream where she started a kitchen fire live.J Names -  In 2022, Mons declared that she distrusted males with names starting with the letter J because of bad past experiences. This is a joke because \"to be fair,  I think statistically a lot of male names start with J\". This has lead to chat forming a 'J Name Gang' in opposition and any game characters with names starting with J automatically becoming her mortal nemesis.Once upon a time, Mons was a normal Kangaroo living in the outback. However, due to an unfortunate possum magic and ‘freak’ cake incident, she became semi-human at the age of 5.No longer fitting in with the other kangaroos and gaining an interest in the human civilization, she soon wandered into the city and made it her new home.With Wi-Fi and her trusty magic pouch, she now shares her hobbies online and hopes to make her own mob, full of friends!","icon":"mons-day.jpeg"}

{"pc":"p254-c2","name":"siddi","languages":["English"],"genres":["Anime","Art","Chatting","Gaming","LGBTQ+","Mature"],"description":"Siddi is an English virtual content creator streaming mainly on Twitch. Her shows are often chaotic, featuring games, art, just chatting community conversations, rants, uncalled for loud yells and dance raves.At the beginning, fear lacked shape. It was a thought, a prickle at the back of the neck, an uneasy feeling, a paranoia, or a self-tormenting doubt. It was the darkness, the unknown, the perilous, the unseen. In the same fold, it was the wonderful, the miraculous, the uncharted, and the unimaginable. When adventurous spirits took to discover the vastness of the world, their greatest fears started to take shape. The worst of their imagined fears gave birth to Siddi as a sentient life. She became their greatest challenge: the Final Boss.After surveying the world, Siddi discovered the great plains of the current day United States midwest to be an ideal location to call her base of operations. She placed her mountain at the center of the continent, with a vast multitude of minions occupying each of its nooks and crannies. She collected treasures and placed them on each floor, leading to the very top where she called her home. With time, most adventurers with the sight to see this other-dimensional mountain would venture in, defeat a few of the low-leveled minions, steal the loot and take off. Each time a room was emptied of its treasures, Siddi would replace it. However, treasure is finite. Eventually those rooms started to house practical nothings, including second-hand goods, with a touch of her enchantment to make it a magical item. Even then, the Final Boss was going broke and the lack of challengers were making it all too tiring.It was around this time that Siddi started to notice the expansion of humanity. The world had shrunk, or perhaps humans have just overtaken almost all of it. The flat, empty lands surrounding the mountain was now littered with teeny tiny homes, and people were \"domesticated.\" Not many held the sight to even see a giant, ominous mountain sitting smack-dab in the middle of suburbia. It wasn't all a loss. A lack of challengers meant a very little need to go out of the way to placate the adventurous spirit. It also meant there was room for other hobbies.As carriages turned to cars, Siddi started to get a whiff of unfamiliar scents. Borrowing a human flesh suit (a human with a sight but no real adventurous spirit to occupy), she ventured out to seek out those smells. This is how the Final Boss was introduced to the first kitchens, delicacies from abroad, heavenly spices and something even newer--food. Since then she has loved to taste every kind of food and has explored a wide variety of culinary delights. She even dabbled in cooking herself. Her self-proclaimed second-in-command, a headless human on first glance, has aided her in discovering new recipes as well as exploring her new found hobby.Fast forward to today, and Siddi has discovered the wonders of the internet. Movies, songs, anime, art and memes were only the start.  Through the aid of her Dungeon Maid (who she created herself, much like most of her minions), she utilizes a rather wonky dimensional gate to broadcast live across the world. She interacts with would-be adventurers, who she sees as slimy blobs through the dimensional gate, shares her recipes, her love for various food types, love for games, her own art and is placated by interacting with adventurers. Her on-screen personality can be described as a chaotic mixture of Tsun-Yan-Kuu and Kamidere. She is also very vocal about her hatred for water, and bad games. Although most would say she's just tormenting the adventurers, it is keen to note the Final Boss is more often-than-not is bullied by the adventurers themselves.As of August 2021: The modern-day fears are still continuing to fuel her. Her current appearance is that of a small human, a female, with horns and fangs. She has clarified to her viewers that she is conforming her flesh to look like she wears clothing, although as a monster, that's unnecessary. Without that clothing, her body is littered with dark, miniature black holes. As a monster, Siddi is gender fluid but is accepting of being referred by title, she/her/they/him/daddy. After teasing about having tentacles for some time, she has most recently revealed her second-form. In that form, she is lifted up to a looming 12 feet in height (365.76cm) by an unconfirmed number of giant tentacles. Each of the tentacles seem to be fashioned out of the night sky. As of now, she has hinted at a third form but has not shared any further details.","icon":"siddi.jpeg"}

{"pc":"p275-c3","name":"Kyublitz","languages":["English"],"genres":["Anime","Art","Chatting","Gaming"],"description":"Kyublitz is a male YouTuber and Twitch Streamer who streams in English. His YouTube channel is a mix of his IRL and Virtual YouTuber content while his live streams are dedicated to the virtual persona version of himself. His live streams are well known for his Friday night VTuber-themed live talk show called \"The Virtual Night Show With Kyublitz\" and his Wednesday night live podcast series called \"KyuCast\" He also does livestreams where he plays video games such as Pokemon and Super Smash Bros Ultimate and chat while hanging out with his fans.His birthday is 19th of December.\nHis zodiac sign is Sagittarius.Kyublitz was actually born a cambion, which is a half-human and half-incubus hybrid. But due to hell's law of no half-breeds, he was sent to earth when he was a baby. (His mother is actually a VTuber herself, and she's a Neko-succubus, ItsAnEmi is the name). After being sent to earth, he was raised in an adopted family. Pretty much raised in a normal lifestyle despite being bullied due to his speech. He is also legally deaf so he uses hearing aids to hear, they're under the headphones. (This is also a reference to IRL me being legally deaf with speech problems, I also hide my hearing aids under my headphones. The whole incubus lore makes more sense due to how in some IRL religions past considered that if a baby was born with a deformity or disabled, they are considered a crossbreed between a human and an incubus since those religions don't think a human and a human offsprings don't make babies who are disabled). When he got older, he eventually moved to California to pursue his dreams of being skilled in multimedia. (I'm similar in that IRL since I moved to California to become a video editor, a graphic designer, and a social media manager for other content creators, also do content creation myself, trying to get into other media such as music, and acting, and more!). But once he got to California, he met a strange \"person\" (Most likely an angel) and gave Kyu the power of \"Space\", but right now, it's mostly gravity-like powers like pulling people closer to him for example. With this power, he developed the \"Halo\" which is actually just a reference to Saturn's rings. Alongside developing the power, he basically has an alter ego that is finally \"unleashed\" aka Fallen which was the \"incubus\" side of him that was locked away, so you could say this mysterious person who gave Kyu's his power basically unleashed his incubus side of him. Fallen isn't considered \"Evil\", just more of a chaotic and mischievous side of him, like a jokester or some sort.As he lives in California and sometimes travels around the world, he ended up finding his true family's history. Which is just basically his mother having a one-night stand or something. His mother aka ItsAnEmi basically finally met him after 23 years of explaining who he is and what he is. He still tries to have a normal human life... But things are getting weird I'd say. Now there's succubus roaming around knowing who he is, disliking him since he's a half-breed. He made a joke with his mother saying he could try to become the \"Prince of the Succubus/Incubus\" which is basically turned into an actual goal.

She does occasional 'story' games once or twice a week.False is from a far away land not of this realm. She was born into a royal family that has met a terrible fate from within its own blood line. Her step mother banished False and her brother to be exiled and even attempted to murder them, False being the only one to escape. Almost losing her own life she made a deal with a ancient kitsune spirit, Unmei, in the forbidden forest. If they join bodies then the spirit would lend their power to False for her to be able to live and get revenge. This is both a blessing and a curse as Unmei has their own agenda and their personality is much crueler than False's. False went back to the kingdom she once called home and with the help of Unmei she was able to get revenge for her brother, her kingdom. With no heir to the throne False was claimed the new Empress of Nyrheim. Her and Unmei fight to do the right thing in their own means some ways harsher than others. One day False was given a book by a scholar from another kingdom. False accepted the book as a gift but later opened it in her bed room. Little did she know it was a enchanted book that teleported to another dimension. The one you and I know today. She's been here for a few years now finally accustomed to our language, attire and culture. Even though she can live here comfortably she still looks for a way back to her kingdom to this day. Perhaps she will find it one day and everything will be okay. But as of now she lives a normal life as if nothing happened. She took comfort in video games as they have the same fantasy feel as her homeland. It keeps her mind off of being homesick and wondering if everyone is okay. Join her in her gaming adventure and story. Every now and then you may just see Unmei take a peak.","icon":"false-kingdom-or.png"}

Mai, meaning dance, and Melody meaning melody, her name is a direct translation of the word song. She is the personification of music, a dance of musical notes forming into a beautiful melody.The Sound was one of the first creations of the Creator, making her a vital pillar for humanity. Along with her siblings, Rhythm and Harmony, they blessed the universe with their symphony.Eons later, Melody took a leap of faith and became human, adopting the name Mai Melody instead. Reborn as an infant, mama and papa Melody raised her as one of their own, knowing that she was not completely human.Now in the present, Mai finds herself to be a beacon of light in her own \"sanctuary\" for humans lost astray amid the cruelty of the world, whom she calls Darlings.As she continues to nourish every one of her beloved darlings with her everlasting love, one would eventually realize that the place they know and love could sometimes be winding and ominous.However, none of them wishes to cease receiving the endless warmth and love that Mai blesses them with every day.None of them wishes to get out. None of them could get out.As one of the wisest among them said: \"Why would we want to get out anyway?\"Malice was inevitable, even in the Music realm. Where there was light, there was darkness. Where there was Euphony, there was Cacophony. While Melody is the Queen of Euphony, her counteract, Kakkovvony is the Queen of Cacophony. They've formed a vow, a sacred balance that was never meant to be broken.Taken from the Greek word 'Kakos', the word Kakkovvony had a new meaning, a mix of both Kakos and Cacophony. Queen Kakkovvony became jealous of Melody's accomplishment, desiring something that she could never have. No matter how hard she tried, Kakkovony could never bless anyone. All she could do was curse mankind.Now, unlike Harmony and Melody, Queen Kakkovo grew mighty from the negative energy of oppressed mortals. With the help of traitors, she transformed into Mai, secretly taking over her role when she wasn't around, cursing her Darlings. The deception was proven to be effective, at least for a short period of time. A wave of distress rolled in, deafening humans with their bad sound. Impostors arose, luring mortals to a dangerous path the Melody would never take.Under the influence of Queen Kakkovvony Mai Darlings turned gloomy. Alas, a curse and a blessing would collide, there was no middle ground. It didn't take a genius to distinguish the difference between the two. Mai the Melody finally declared war between the two.To protect mortals, first, Mai has to strip off her human body, transforming back into her true deity form.","icon":"mai-melody.png"}

He streams mainly in Spanish but he also answers in English to those viewers who wants to practice their Spanish or they don't know the language at all.His community is very welcoming and warm with the new members of The Dungeon, so you will feel part of a family very fast.I still remember that day, even though centuries have passed ever since. The beginning of a life condemned to darkness. What? You thought I was born as a demon? You are wrong, I was human like you and my only sin was \"angering the Lord with my heresies and condemning all the people to the wrath of God\". It sounds stupid now, but it didn’t five centuries ago.My \"sin’s\" name was Kurien, he was part of the Royal Guard, while I.... well, I was just an artist's apprentice who was sometimes hired to paint unimportant portraits.The secret of our relationship was a heavy burden for more than seven years and we had been saving up money to flee the country. But all our plans went down the drain. I still don't know how we were discovered, it all happened too fast.I remember the pain in my lungs from running, the barking dogs trying to hunt us down in the forest and the screams of angry villagers.\nIt didn't take long for them to catch up with us. Kurien was beating them with all his might to get them to let us go, but they pinned us down, our own friends took us to the authorities. There was not even a trial, only the sentence to capital punishment, but not without first purifying our sinful souls before that. I don't even remember how many days it was, I lost track of time locked up behind those four walls.At first I prayed, I asked God why was my love a sin, but the torture and humiliation that his faithful dogs did to us not? I begged Him to forgive us, to send someone to stop all that... but I never got an answer. I had never felt a greater hatred growing inside me than during those days. I didn't know if it hurt my body or my soul more, and as expected, so much darkness attracted something even darker.It spoke in my ear day after day. I was convinced I was going crazy.The day of the execution came and I couldn't see Kurien anywhere, I remember my heart shrinking, I wanted to see him one last time before I died. My eyes searched desperately for him through the bars of the cells we were passing.\n\"What you are looking for is outside waiting for you\", the tone in which the guard spoke gave me shivers, I expected the worst.Once outside I tried to enjoy my last breaths of fresh air as I headed towards my destiny. I looked up as they put the noose around my neck and then I saw Kurien’s body exposed on one of the walls as a warning.That being of darkness appeared again at my side, he was cunning, he knew that now I would accept whatever he offered me. It was not even necessary to converse, I just looked at him and nodded with the little strength I had left.The executioner activated the lever that was going to take me to death, but as soon as my body was suspended, it began to burn to carry out my metamorphosis. It is surprising how burning in the very own flames of Hell itself hurt less than I expected.\nI fell on the ground and people began to run away in a wild stampede, pushing and stepping on each other.I went into a frenzy and began to hunt them down no matter who it was. I remember the metallic smell of the blood I was spilling as I went, but I prefer not to go into details. Still, it's not something I'm entirely proud of.I carefully put down Kurien's body on the floor, wiping his face with a damp cloth. My brain didn't want to believe what my eyes were seeing. I couldn't even cry, all I did was shiver as I ran my fingertips over that beautiful face that was now cold and barely recognizable. I hugged him, cradling his body in my arms and pressing a kiss to his forehead.\"Bring him back\", I pleaded with the demon, to which his response was a laugh. \"That was not our deal. I offered you revenge, not to bring him back to life. Now you must come with me.\" , he replied without losing his smile. \"Is he there? In Hell?\" I dared to ask like a naive fool, but his smile widened further. It was obviously a no.\nThat's when my world shattered into pieces and the tears started to flow. It wasn't possible. I didn't want to believe it.\"I want to make another pact!\" I screamed. That being looked me up and down with disdain and simply turned around, ready to leave. \"You have nothing left to bargain with me.\"\n\"I will collect souls for you!\" , that seemed to interest him. He stopped and looked over his shoulder, staring at me with those cold, yellow eyes. \"Every 5,000 souls you bring to me, I'll let you stay with him for 24 hours.\" That was too many people to damn, but if I had to spend an eternity in Hell anyway, I had nothing to lose... If I could see him just one more time, I'd settle for it.\"I accept the deal.\"So many years have passed that I feel that his face begins to fade from my memory.... Sometimes when I try to draw him I feel that’s not the face I loved long ago.I am terrified of forgetting him...","icon":"nekir-xiii.png"}

He streams a variety of games and likes taking the most infuriatingly off meta build to get anything done because he's a closet masochist. His inflated ego will having you wanting to punch him in the face, and you'll hesitate because you think he might actually be daring you to? All bark and no bite, Lark is extremely cautious to not say anything actually offensive or hurtful while teasing his viewers and encourages a healthy light hearted bantering interaction.Lark will never miss an opportunity to tell you he is a Libra, and that they are the best sign. He'll also never ever let you escape your 2012 tumblr phase as he drags you kicking and screaming back down the rabbit hole of homestuck nostalgia on an almost weekly basis. If you ever had a fan troll, he will make you feel safe in digging it out of the garbage before laughing at you for it. This tsundere will never outright say how much he appreciates everyone around him, but he will ask you about your special interests and genuinely listen if that means you'll stick around longer. Once you look past all the snark and bullshit, he's sometimes a thief with a heart of gold.Lark is the World's Greatest Fey Thief. Standing at 2.75 inches tall, which is totally normal for a fairy and definitely not short, Lark earned himself quite a reputation. Living by the code \"No Gods, no Kings\" he quickly faced the harsh reality that even the best get caught sometimes. Stealing from Oberon, the King of fairies and fae, was as easy as all his other heists, however, he just couldn't resist a good taunt on his way out. His performance landed him in a Terrarium like prison. Another prisoner lurked in the brush with him; Saoirse, a \"totally normal mantis\" was assigned to work alongside Lark as an artist while he served out his sentence. How long is that? What a stupid question! Time is subjective in the Feywild.","icon":"liminal-lark.png"}

{"pc":"p347-c8","name":"Wolfie The Medic","languages":["English"],"genres":["Art","Chatting","Gaming"],"description":"An angelic, wolf-like, seiso, and mute shapeshifter. You can find her on the dark neon-lit streets for a game session or on the couch while she draws and creates animations! Long collaboration streams and artwork creation is her primary content. She's all about keeping a positive attitude and having a good time, the comedy of a silent comic.\nDespite being a positive energy puffball, she loves a relaxing environment amongst the chaotic gremlin antics.\nHer general game interest list is multiplayer-oriented, including Team Fortress 2, A Hat in Time, Skullgirls, Don't Starve Together, Deep Rock Galactic, Payday 2, Risk of Rain 2, Monster Prom, and VRChat. Her birthday is January 14th, a Capricorn.What exactly is she? Wolfie is a naïve and enigmatic being adorning several titles, hailing from a virtual city surrounded by neon lights. Among the notable names are the shapeshifting and seiso spirit wolf with wild curiosities; adorable as heck, wholesome, workaholic, celestial, and angelic artist. Though unaware of her background and knowledge, it provides plenty of room for imagination. She was established on Mars and used her space train to travel, producing and consuming love and good vibes. Please allow her to treat your wounds: she studied as a battlefield medic in her spare time.What is she up to? She now spends her free time trying to make those around her laugh while leaving behind a better environment. The most valuable currency in her eyes is other people's happiness, so everything she does is out of kindness with the goal that it will only spread.Kabuki Face Mask: Her bone-textured mask has an attuned ancient pulse that gives it its own sense of living. However, it is unclear if this effect is the cause of her fantasticality or a reflection of her own nature. Her companions are advised to avoid tampering with the cosmetic or the possessor, as the vivid blue ribbon that holds it in place is really a red herring. Its marking design adorns the kanji 山犬 (wolf) on the front and inexplicably glows from beneath.\nFashion Night light tech and comfort wear are her go-to outfits. Her love/hate relationship with fashion is complicated since she appears to be able to pull off any look. It can shift from black to pastels, tartan to canvas; it changes as much as the wind blows.Appearance: Shapeshifting enables her to transform into and imitate power based on observation. Despite this, she prefers the consistent appearance of a human with a few wolf characteristics because it does not tire her abilities. Her thematic reference for a base look: dark blue hair with a signature heart-ended ponytail, thick side fringes, matching wolf ears, a white highlighted blue heart-tipped tail, heterochromatic pink and blue heart (or watch face) pupils, and a smug innocent smile.\nHer halo, which hovers over one ear, is aesthetic: she wears it to bring light around her, physically and mentally. But what about those extra ears and tail? Natural! Drawing focus is the key to her sharp attention, even if she can be a little airheaded, blind, or deaf.She lacks a personified voice and instead depends on a computer-girl automaton to synthesize Text To Speech communication. That is if she isn't imitating soundboard vocal cords or becoming a Vocaloid.Dreams and free time: She can be found reclining when she is not working to the bone in productivity. It's not out of the realm of possibility that she's simply too comfy and falls asleep. Breaks are unfamiliar to her, so it's either all energy or no energy, with no between ground. She has a peculiarity that prevents her from manifesting dreams, rather she leaps from one to the next during her nights.Occupation: However, she has many more responsibilities in paradise than streaming, animating, and acting as a private detective (Cloud K9 Unit). One is the proprietor of a genuine cat maid cafe. The so-called Top Hat Caitmaid Cafe is located in a different compartment of the mammoth train. This enterprise is more of a side hustle humor, causing fun confusion. The employees are VTubers or pals who have lost bets. Come and be served by the crew, or join in! Her personal VTubing takes place in the back office, where wires are entangled in homemade technology. Only a bean-like girl manages to conceal within this stowaway portion of the train. Heaven is blind to her side jobs while the train travels between planets and mortal strata. And for what purpose? All for the sake of smiles!Barkeep: On The Run is a pop-up bar compartment on Her refurbished train, decked up to reflect her and her love of tech and retro with a dash of steampunk thrown in for good measure. Rails can't hold it in place, and it continues to go on its own. The station is a lively gathering place that changes from night to night. Many become regulars, with the established reputation that anyone attempting to harm the establishment or the bartender will yearn for a second abyss to exist. Quite an accomplishment, given the inherently dangerous clients. AKA don't bother her devil pals.","icon":"wolfie-the-medic.png"}

She is often lewd, attributing this to her rabbit-like nature. However, she can also be quite wholesome and bubbly. She loves to talk and play with her viewers and has a running Minecraft server for her community. Be warned if she is fond of you, and if you are also a streamer, you will be aggressively shouted out as you are now in her territory.She isn't afraid to talk about real things happening in her life, and how she is dealing with them, or her goals for her Twitch. She also refuses to be afraid to talk about her numbers on Twitch, and how excited she is about them. It has been said that she can not lie, and prefers honesty over all. Luna is a very down to Earth streamer who only wants to make you smile!It has been noted that when she is lonely and alone in her private voice chat, she will start to sing whatever tune comes to her.On November 13th, 2021, Luna trapped herself into an Uncapped Subathon which ended after 151 days, the same number of Pokemon were in the first generation. Luna was unsatisfied that a massive internet outage ended her subathon, but due to internet troubles was unable to continue properly.Luna is a Moon Goddess in the form of a White Jade Rabbit who came to Earth to find out why they were losing their magic! So she said, anyway. We now understand it was a misplaced teleport that landed her on Earth. However, she did decide to stay.Along the way she discovered it was due to humans not believing in Gods and Goddesses anymore. Unhappy with this result, but thinking nothing could be done, Luna made some friends and eventually started streaming on Twitch with them! When people commented, or followed, well any interaction really, she started to get some of her magic back! She wishes to return to her true form some day!But that isn’t all! Luna revealed on December 21st, 2021, the Winter Solstice and longest night of the year (her debut), that she wasn’t ALWAYS a goddess. She ascended at a young age and grew into the goddess we know and love today. Some viewers theorize that Luna is not \"The Moon Goddess humans have worshiped throughout time,\" as she has said, and that she is actually not much more than a few centuries old.On April 1, 2022 Luna's sister Chi joined the stream for the Anniversary Festivities instead of Luna. While no one knows what Chi's motives were, it was clear they were checking in on their sister, wanted to be heir to the throne, and may have been up to no good before she found the livestream. She participated in playing Among Us for several hours before she left when Luna woke up. Luna suffered no injuries to anyone's knowledge.Her godly domains have been revealed to be Moon, Ocean, Knowledge, Arcana, Battle and Death. There are many sub-domains related to these such as Healing, Storm, and Soul. She seems to be frightened of her potential, and often downplays how powerful she may be. It is unknown to what lengths her abilities may stretch.She is also known as Princess Luna, heir to the throne in the Luminan Kingdom. While she has many illegitimate siblings, both older and younger than her, she is peaceful and gets along with all of them. There does not appear to be much, if any infighting over the throne.The Luminan Kingdom appears to be matriarchal, and is ruled by Luna’s mother Queen Selene.Luna grew up in the Luminan Temples, and was trained traditionally as a priestess, until her ascension. She is a known scholar as well and holds many magical talents such as the ability to shape change and a specialization in healing. Healing is said to have its drawbacks, however she has not said what these are. She has the ability to slip between rays of moonbeams similar to shadow walking, and is said to have a wispy form that is similar to a will-o-wisp in the shape of a rabbit.It has been said there are Shadow-based Moon Rabbits that live on the Dark Side of the Moon. Their Kingdom has not yet been spoken about on stream in detail, but Luna has heavily suggested her father is one of the royals from that side. This gives question to why Luna is brightly coloured, but it is theorized it may be due to her will-o-wisp nature.There is clear tension between Luna and her mother Queen Selene. Her mother is said to be fairly strict, likely leading to Luna’s wide range of magical abilities and knowledge, but it is clear Luna does not always follow her mother’s direction and may have been rebellious and snuck away to fight in some battles during wartime in the kingdom.It is unclear Luna’s family is aware of her exploration of Earth, or her streaming career. It has been stated that the Human species is considered “frightening” and “barbaric” due to their inability to get along on a world-wide scale to the Luminan people. Luna is wary of human-kind, but understands not all of humanity is frightening. She has a love of humanity, and wishes that her people could communicate with humans more often.A little under a year after Luna began streaming on Twitch as LunalaiMoonglow on Earth a strange black feline with a cyan tie located her and insisted that she was to come with him to the Citadel of Fannearath, and furthermore the Library of Aether. The Library of Aether is said to have all known knowlege, all written books, and detailed information about even the gods and workings of magic itself. This feline, referred to as Kitty, is an I.I.M.S.B.C. or an International Interdimensional Magitech Support Business Cat.He informed Luna that he was there to help her return to her godly duties after her misplaced teleport and was surprised to find she was continuing her duties talking directly to humans on Earth via streaming. While this is a VAST breach of conduct code, as divine beings are not meant to be seen as everyday creatures, it seemed to be doing little to no damage as humans did not understand they were communicating with an actual goddess.As of May of 2022, Kitty has accepted Managerial duties over Luna's streams and has convinced her to move her operations to the Citadel of Fannearath so that he may continue his work there and ensure that she does not reveal herself to her audience as an actual goddess. His support of her antics are confusing to many of the sphinx that inhabit the Citadel and Library however it is widely regarded that they have an odd bond and it has kept Luna out of other trouble.On October 31st, 2022 Luna unveiled and debuted her shadow form. She stated she has a Moonlit form, and Shadow form due to her Father being from the Dark Side of the Moon, and her mother being from the Light Side of the Moon.","icon":"lunalai-moonglow.png"}

His personality is chaotic, but has a very mature and sultry undertone when engaging in serious conversations with his community.The three ruling families of Japan all worshipped separate members within the deity hierarchy: Agohige (Amaterasu Omikami), Munashi (Tsukyomi), and Same [pronounced \"sah-meh\"] (Susanoo). The Agohige and Munashi families led Japan in close proximity, w/ the Munashi family living in the Agohige shadow... just as the moon fleets when morning comes. The Same family was more of the rugged fashion, yet controlled the ports & navy under the blessing of Susanoo.Aeon and his sister Hoshi were born to Reonidasu & Osori Agohige, and he was being groomed to reign over Japan as soon as he could walk. Under the adoring supervision of Amaterasu, Aeon was raised as both a leader and as a warrior; he was lethal with most conventional weaponry by the age of 12, and was an exceptional scholar. Aeon also had an ungodly appetite - as a child, his birthday feasts would be equal to that of the Same naval fleet banquets.Hoshi was just as aggressive as her younger brother, and quickly rose through the ranks of the Crimson Guard, the Agohige family's personal military. She was strong, and Aeon looked up to her in every way, despite Reonidasu's plans for him.All seemed well... until it wasn't.Negai Munashi, the patriarch of the Munashi family, grew quite tired of living in the shadow of Reonidasu. In an attempt to snatch the throne of Japan, Negai signed a pact w/ Tsukyomi to open the gates to the Land of the Dead - unleashing a horde of demons upon Gisei, the fortress kingdom where the Agohige family lived and prospered. The brutal ambush happened overnight, and the last images in Aeon's mind were that of his father, fighting off waves of the undead as he and Hoshi attempted to protect the gates for Aeon and Osori to be able to escape. As they ran from the burning castle they were stopped in the middle of the road by Yoru Munashi, wife of Negai & sworn Agohige enemy, as she herself was once a member of their household who attempted to steal Reonidasu's heart. Lunging for Osori's neck, Aeon blocks the attack & is mortally wounded in the process - now housing a gaping hole in his ribcage.Struggling to get back to his feet, Yoru makes Aeon watch as his mother is slain, seconds before kicking him off of the ledge. As he falls he sheds one solitary tear, his mind plagued by all of those he failed to save.When he awakes, he is now in the mortal realm - however, he is all alone.He is then greeted by Lady Amaterasu herself, and is then given an opportunity to avenge his family. He readily accepts.\nAs she puts him into a deep slumber, his life as a demi-god is about to begin...","icon":"aeon-agohige.png"}

However, she did decide to stay.Along the way she discovered it was due to humans not believing in Gods and Goddesses anymore. Unhappy with this result, but thinking nothing could be done, Luna made some friends and eventually started streaming on Twitch with them! When people commented, or followed, well any interaction really, she started to get some of her magic back! She wishes to return to her true form some day!But that isn’t all! Luna revealed on December 21st, 2021, the Winter Solstice and longest night of the year (her debut), that she wasn’t ALWAYS a goddess. She ascended at a young age and grew into the goddess we know and love today. Some viewers theorize that Luna is not \"The Moon Goddess humans have worshiped throughout time,\" as she has said, and that she is actually not much more than a few centuries old.On April 1, 2022 Luna's sister Chi joined the stream for the Anniversary Festivities instead of Luna. While no one knows what Chi's motives were, it was clear they were checking in on their sister, wanted to be heir to the throne, and may have been up to no good before she found the livestream. She participated in playing Among Us for several hours before she left when Luna woke up. Luna suffered no injuries to anyone's knowledge.Her godly domains have been revealed to be Moon, Ocean, Knowledge, Arcana, Battle and Death. There are many sub-domains related to these such as Healing, Storm, and Soul. She seems to be frightened of her potential, and often downplays how powerful she may be. It is unknown to what lengths her abilities may stretch.She is also known as Princess Luna, heir to the throne in the Luminan Kingdom. While she has many illegitimate siblings, both older and younger than her, she is peaceful and gets along with all of them. There does not appear to be much, if any infighting over the throne.The Luminan Kingdom appears to be matriarchal, and is ruled by Luna’s mother Queen Selene.Luna grew up in the Luminan Temples, and was trained traditionally as a priestess, until her ascension. She is a known scholar as well and holds many magical talents such as the ability to shape change and a specialization in healing. Healing is said to have its drawbacks, however she has not said what these are. She has the ability to slip between rays of moonbeams similar to shadow walking, and is said to have a wispy form that is similar to a will-o-wisp in the shape of a rabbit.It has been said there are Shadow-based Moon Rabbits that live on the Dark Side of the Moon. Their Kingdom has not yet been spoken about on stream in detail, but Luna has heavily suggested her father is one of the royals from that side. This gives question to why Luna is brightly coloured, but it is theorized it may be due to her will-o-wisp nature.There is clear tension between Luna and her mother Queen Selene. Her mother is said to be fairly strict, likely leading to Luna’s wide range of magical abilities and knowledge, but it is clear Luna does not always follow her mother’s direction and may have been rebellious and snuck away to fight in some battles during wartime in the kingdom.It is unclear Luna’s family is aware of her exploration of Earth, or her streaming career. It has been stated that the Human species is considered “frightening” and “barbaric” due to their inability to get along on a world-wide scale to the Luminan people. Luna is wary of human-kind, but understands not all of humanity is frightening. She has a love of humanity, and wishes that her people could communicate with humans more often.A little under a year after Luna began streaming on Twitch as LunainJapan on Earth a strange black feline with a cyan tie located her and insisted that she was to come with him to the Citadel of Fannearath, and furthermore the Library of Aether. The Library of Aether is said to have all known knowlege, all written books, and detailed information about even the gods and workings of magic itself. This feline, referred to as Kitty, is an I.I.M.S.B.C. or an International Interdimensional Magitech Support Business Cat.He informed Luna that he was there to help her return to her godly duties after her misplaced teleport and was surprised to find she was continuing her duties talking directly to humans on Earth via streaming. While this is a VAST breach of conduct code, as divine beings are not meant to be seen as everyday creatures, it seemed to be doing little to no damage as humans did not understand they were communicating with an actual goddess.As of May of 2022, Kitty has accepted Managerial duties over Luna's streams and has convinced her to move her operations to the Citadel of Fannearath so that he may continue his work there and ensure that she does not reveal herself to her audience as an actual goddess. His support of her antics are confusing to many of the sphinx that inhabit the Citadel and Library however it is widely regarded that they have an odd bond and it has kept Luna out of other trouble.","icon":"lunain-japan.png"}

Her main roster of games currently consists of Dungeon Fighter Online, Arknights, and Final Fantasy XIV. She has been an official content creator for Dungeon Fighter Online since March 2021.In a realm far removed from that of the humans, there exists a mysterious god who appeared as a giant flower; they dreamed and gave life to people. The people gave their god the name \"Her Inflorescence\". After realizing that Her Inflorescence would also take their lives away, they pursued immortality and thus exiled their own god. Their distance from Her Inflorescence eventually turned them all into demons with white horns.One day, Sunga was born with black horns, and many of her kind found this to be an omen of the return of Her Inflorescence. After some conflict where Sunga lost one of her eyes, a part of Her Inflorescence bloomed in its place. She was ultimately exiled from her kingdom, as she was believed to be a bringer of calamity upon her kind because of her connection to their old god. When Sunga arrived in the human realm, she was not able to fit in amongst the humans until she met a mysterious woman, whom she refers to as the Maiden.In exchange for learning how to live with humans, Sunga made a promise to the Maiden, and the Maiden then instructed her descendants to help Sunga keep her promise until it is time for her to leave the human realm.","icon":"sungahime.jpeg"}

She frequently plays Eternal Return: Black Survival at a skilled level. She also greatly enjoys sandbox and simulation games, however she is also very interested in RPG games. Occasionally, she will stream gacha games like Arknights or Genshin Impact.. Her streams are currently mostly chill, however her viewers have noted that she is very degenerate and not afraid to be a toxic gamer.Her hashtags are #MeMelon for general content, #ArterMelon for art, and #VioMelons for NSFW art. She has stated that memes would go under either the #MeMelon or #ArterMelon tag, as memes are also a form of art.In a world where magic and mythical creatures roamed, a watermelon was growing in a small, quaint garden. From sprout all the way to ripe watermelon, the watermelon grew. The melon was then harvested, and put into a picnic basket. For watermelons, being eaten isn't a sad fate, for it was far better than the alternative of rotting to death. At least by being eaten, a watermelon can bring some creature sustenance and potentially happiness before it finally dies. The watermelon was carried in its basket to a beach, where a group of lady knights were enjoying their vacation. The landscape was beautiful, and the lady knights were basking under the sun. Then, the commander of the knights decided to flaunt her strength by taking the watermelon that was so preciously delivered all the way from its former garden home to this idyllic beach setting, and she put the melon between her thighs. And squeezed. The watermelon was crushed, inedible, and finally, the melon's life was no more.A voice rang from above. \"Oh small watermelon, your fate was a disgraceful one for an upbringing so peaceful.\" The watermelon realized where it was, and with that realization came the shock that it was speaking to a god. The god then broke the silence, stating \"I will give you another chance at life, this time as a human.\" With the end of the sentence, the watermelon lost consciousness.When she awoke, she was in a field that sprawled as far as the eye could see, the soft sunlight beaming down onto her. She was now on Earth, with a human body. She was isekai'd from what Earth humans would call a fantasy world, to this new world controlled by technology and complex societies.With her naturally green hair and red eyes due to her past life, she frequently stuck out in any environment other than at anime conventions and the like. After getting a grasp on technology, she quickly found solace in virtual communities, where others looked more similar to her. Due to this, to try and acclimate more to Earth, she has begun to explore the world of online gaming and online communities more.","icon":"viosmic.png"}

He streams a variety of content including cover and original music, art and design, readings of poetry and discussions on literature, ASMR, collabs and podcast and music shows with guests, and of course his first chaotic forays into games.Emerson Key was born in 1902, with a dormant gift for perceiving and navigating fourth and fifth dimensional planes. As these abilities were awakening in his teenage years, he was recruited into the Continuum Confederation, an organization which operates outside the dimension of time. He was mentored under esteemed time travelers and mages, and nominated to train to become a Chronomancer, one of the few master archmages and gods of time, granted the Nebula of Time for use and safekeeping.With his future already charted out in its infinite possibilities, he currently has been working up the ranks as a Causality Chronographer for the Confederation, recording and investigating timelines across the multiverse to ensure all runs as it should. For many years he has traversed many universes and timelines, enforcing the rules of time, eliminating threats as necessary and otherwise maintaining archival responsibilities. Remaining ageless and unaffected by time, and seeing all that could be seen, in infinite quantum possibilities, he has become restless and cynical with the rise and fall of species and civilizations.Recently however, he and his fellow Continuum agents discovered an error which is beginning to cascade and cause ripple effects across timelines. In order to stop an unforeseen and unapproved calamity he has arrived in 2021. With the help of his community and many other fellow time travelers, perhaps the calamity and the source of the problem may be stopped.However, things are not as simple. Unfamiliar with deeper involvements outside of shepherding timelines and beyond fate as the future has shown, will Key choose sides when he discovers the forces behind it all? Will a titanic clash between otherworldly and mythic powers be the end of the universe as we know it? Or will the Continuum Alliance succeed while Emerson Key unlocks his true potential as a Chronomancer?He must embark across worlds and timelines, physical, spiritual and digital, to take on battles and investigate how to stop the unstoppable.","icon":"emerson-key.png"}

Helping others with both their content & technology-related issues, he doesn't ask for anything in return. You might even consider him a kind person but he'll never admit to that.He is also known for never sleeping & overworking himself too much. His solution to this? Caffeine of course! Oddly enough, IRL he has heart problems but has said he had more complications when not consuming caffeine, thus puzzling his doctors. You may have noticed his logo is a broken heart. Makes sense now doesn't it? He has a sense of humor about his health & doesn't let it stop him from living his life how he sees fit!His PC Pheonix has caught fire twice only for him to use his technomancy to revive it both times. He has a lot of PC issues due to having only secondhand & faulty parts but he does what he can to still make content. These are just challenges for him to overcome!His main anthro design is inspired by the African Spectacled Dormouse. Yes, he is aware that they are technically not mice but they are cute & he likes them. Don't question it.Back during the birth of the modern computer, glitches became apparent. Glitches often caused a fixable issue but sometimes the solution was more difficult. This was an opening...Demons throughout history have always looked for a new grip to have on humanity for their war with those from the angelic realm. Power being heightened by belief has been their struggle since the beginning. But demons have one advantage that those from up above lacked; adaptability. There have been demons of all types, from those of an animalistic form to those of regions & land. But this? This was new.Technology is still relatively new in the span of time mankind has existed. The demons saw an opportunity with the invention of the computer.Glitches... Common, bothersome, believable, perfect!So a decision was made. The higher-ups of the demon realm came together to bring forth a new kind of demon. Glitch demons. So through the darkness came forth this new being, each able to choose their own name. This is where some problems arose. Many of these glitch demons chose names related to the kind of glitch they liked most or technology or even places from the human world. However there was one who thought they were clever, they were not, but they thought they were. Trash...Trash had chosen that name due to believing that since many humans feared being overwhelmed with waste that it would serve him extra strength. Unfortunately for him, though granted more power, it also gave him the same intelligence as garbage. In his now smol brain state he wanted to add more to his powers & how better to do this than to use one of the most useful parts of a computer? The mouse! But Trash had never seen a mouse before so using his powers to connect to the internet he searched for \"mouse\" on a popular search engine.What would normally be confusing for any demon had made perfect sense to him since his brain was fried. So he decided to take on the powers of a mouse as well. Thus, Trash_Mouse__ was created. A strange name for sure but somehow, some way, it worked in his favor. Taking on the aspects of both an animal & a glitch made him the first of his kind. A glitch demon with powers of another type of demon as well. Seeing this, the demon realm was in an uproar. A hybrid had never existed before. The glitch demons would have the power to \"glitch\" the laws of their world. Order would disappear from their existence & the old demons would fade away as more glitch demons emerged. So the glitch demons were no longer created. Feeling fortunate the first & only glitch demon to discover this also made itself an imbecile, they sent him to live in the human world & instructed him to stay there forevermore.Knowing no better, Trash_Mouse__ began to integrate himself into human society online using the one thing he knew how to do: being a fool. He found by bringing happiness to humans with his incompetence he was gaining more & more powers. By tuning into his streams & watching his videos the belief in him grew to make him not only the dumbest but also the most powerful glitch demon to ever exist. He was no longer just fueled by the belief that glitches existed but by humans knowing of him specifically.Though there was something that had not been foreseen by him claiming the powers of a rodent, though many humans feared mice only adding to his strength, many also loved them. Through this, he gained power from the human's appreciation as well.Odd as it may be, he has chosen to go by Trash instead of any variation of \"Mouse\", leaving that to very few that he has become close with. To him, it became something he wanted to keep special for those closest to him. Though it is entirely possible he is just more in tune with identifying as rubbish...","icon":"trash-mouse.png"}

He loves dogs, coffee, dad jokes, and solving cases and puzzles.His pronouns are he/they. His birthday is January 22 and he's an Aquarius.Avalon Rose was a good kid growing up; staying away from the bad crowd and keeping himself on a relatively straight path. After graduating from school, Avalon left his old life to live on his own.As he was contemplating whether to pursue higher education or apply for a job, Avalon stumbled upon a crime scene. A robbery had happened the other night, and the authorities had started investigating the area. Avalon peered in along with the curious crowd, trying to make sense of the scene. While Avalon's train of thought was running all over the place, a man claiming to be 'the greatest detective in history' started deducing loudly regarding the crime to the head inspector. Everyone surrounding the scene could hear him, including Avalon.At that exact moment, Avalon was in awe at the man's wide array of knowledge and the confidence surrounding his deductions. The man had got a hold of Avalon's admiration, and he proceeded to ask if said man was willing to teach Avalon and be his mentor.Now, Avalon lives in an apartment with his mentors, Mr. H and Mr. W, the landlord, and their dog. Avalon's room is in the apartment building's storage attic. He's working under his mentors' private investigation agency, H&W P.I. Office, which is not associated with law enforcement.During his debut, Avalon accidentally showed a ripped page from a police report. The title read \"Case File: H&W P.I. Office\". Some of the important keywords from the page were scribbled out, but the more relevant parts of the case file were available to read. An anonymous witness stated that they find it quite odd that a series of cold cases that caused the police so much time and trouble were solved so fast by a private detective agency; namely the H&W P.I. Office. They also claimed that despite the agency being made many years ago, the cases started getting solved recently; sometime after they recruited their newest member.The case file also had an evidence list section, where it lists the relevant evidence to the mentioned cold cases. There were also polaroid pictures of various ciphers left at some of the crime scenes. A suspect info section is also on the page, but whatever is written there is covered by the polaroids.How Avalon got a hold of the page remains a mystery, and whether or not he'll explain this in the future is unknown. All the people know for now is that something big is hiding behind the 'greatest rookie detective'.","icon":"avalon-rose.jpeg"}

A soul full of electricity, powered by the love and admiration she tightly held onto so she could make her dreams come true. Her clothes the ones the other truly wanted to wear but she felt she couldn’t… She wanted to help her… She wanted to have her dream become a reality… she wanted to be someone… she wanted to shine… and she only wanted to express her passionate desire to do such things… her anger… let the world know and reflect her voice, distribute her voice, whether in happiness and joy or anger and sadness…And she… she loved having her by her side, until her fears continued to join in. She felt as if though only using Micro she could be that which she wanted… she felt that… only the other could be the one to soar… when the reality is… Micro is just as much as her… as she is Micro…\nShe is her microphone, She is her voice, Micro is her in every personality aspect and every feeling that goes and escapes her lips. If she shines, C shines, if C shines Micro shines.And thus.. Micro will not cease to exist until she finishes her dreams… until she reaches that top","icon":"microphona-sing.jpeg"}

Once living as an exorcist assigned to the West, they were left culture-shocked in the mainland. Nyx loves and appreciates their fans, deeming the most loyal as true Baddies, and inviting the most powerful to join their Yakultists.

Traditionally, a Babaylon serves as someone like a medium, the liason between worlds.

Some of their favorite games are Genshin Impact and Life Is Strange.

The bat-human hybrid uses any pronouns, though she identifies as female, is LGBTQ+ friendly, and can sometimes be NSFW (very seiso). Chiro is constantly trying to improve their streaming quality with what equipment they have!In Kokong av stål; a realm where the growth of half-blood bats are continuously progressing, covens inlaid with occult magic have also started to form; and with it, comes the Coven Hierarchy; the true rank of power — the testament to one's reputable ability to conjure magic.The Myskia Coven is sat at the top of this hierarchy. Composed of half-blood bats with human-like features, no one else in the cauldron of bats could ever overcome their power. Though during one stormy night, as the sky wept asunder, a certain bat was born. A daughter of lightning and thunder, comes the chosen of the Myskia Coven.Myskia Chiro could transform from her human-like form to a bat on command. This ability came with its benefits, whether it be on instances of spying, or conjuring forms of magic that have never been conjured by any half-blood bat before. Myskia Chiro was the new pearl of the Myskia Coven — the bat mentioned in all the prophecies. However, amidst all the expectations laid upon them, she chooses to walk among the chains as she goes against her family and continuously refuse to conjure magic for the sake of the Coven Hierarchy. It's not that the young bat is not interested in witchraft, it's simply the fact that she would rather use it through other means; by learning more about the magic in her realm, by exploring its true nature, its origins, and capabilities.Thus, she went on a hunt for the greatest wizard bat in ancient wizardry. The bat who knows how to conjure magic for its rightful use; Fladdermaus. During her journey, they discovered the act of streaming, and have finally found joy in their life amidst her family's suffocating restrictions. Along with this, he has also uncovered a talent for poetry, as she records her emotions and feelings throughout their journey, including what she feels as a part of the strict and suffocating Myskia Coven. In order to avoid disputes, she uses the pen name \"angustiaelle.\"Chiro dreams that someday, when her journey comes to a crescendo, she hopes that she can put an end to the unjust use of magic and the toxic competitiveness of the Coven Hierarchy, too.But until then, they will be streaming ^•ﻌ•^With her eyes peeled for Fladdermaus, of course!","icon":"myskia-chiro.jpeg"}

Her chosen place to live in was England and was able to settle in very quickly in her new home. When going outdoors, she normally hides her cat ears with a hat and her tail underneath her dress. Luckily, most humans will think that she just likes fancy dresses and does not think her of some catgirl or possible a \"alien\". For the past 7+ years, she was able to get a job, purchase essentials and even find love.\nAs a side effect of going into a new environment [or even a new planet], there was a side effect. Kitty's stomach became very sensitive ever since she moved to Earth. Some food just did not sit with her and caused pain, discomfort and even causing trips to the hospital.

Since having a sensitive stomach, she now uses the money that she saved up for to go to different doctors around England to find a way to control her digestive condition/illness.","icon":"kitty-gemma.jpeg"}

Due to the trauma from her fall, she lost all her memories. She was found by a Prince, who took her in and cared for her until she was well. She became his servant and continued to grow up at his side.They were 13 when he admitted he had always loved her.Afraid for his safety, the princess used her powers to seal all memories of that love away. It was only until they were 18 that those emotions were returned to him and she admitted she had loved him and felt they had been destined from the moment they'd first met. They were married in secret and a few months later, the princess was pregnant with their first child. A few months into her pregnancy, she became ill. No healer was able to find the cause, let alone a cure. The Prince felt hopeless. The Couple was forced to return to the castle, The Prince was forced to seek aid from the very parents who had shunned them.Shortly after, a regent arrived from The Moon and recognized the princess. He stated that her illness was due to her having been away from home for such a long time. Bringing her back to The Moon would heal her instantly.  There was one more dilemma that our couple had to face.  The Queen had cast a spell on the kingdom, wiping away all memory of the princess’s existence from history.Desperate to save his beloved, the prince wished for a way to cure her. That wish was heard by a dark force, filling him with false promises of saving his wife. He was alone, picking white roses, when he was enticed by a voice.Without delay The Prince went to The Moon without informing anyone. When he arrived, he was instantly affected by the Queen’s spell; as such he forgot all about his wife and his unborn child, falling instead for her younger sister. Having witnessed this, The Regent went to fetch The Princess, bringing her home. When they arrived, they saw that The Moon was under attack by the Dark Forces. The moment The Princess set foot on The Moon, she felt considerably better, until she saw her husband with the younger princess. Her heart shattered.Using whatever power she had, she fought back the evil forces that were threatening The Moon but not before the threat had claimed the lives of her beloved and her sister. Her sacrifice cost her everything.To her shock, The Queen saw her Eldest daughter and was helpless to stop what had transpired. Everyone was gone, both of her children, grandchild, and her people.The Queen used the last of her strength to put the entire royal court including The Princess and her beloved Prince, into stasis so they would be reborn on Earth in the future.The Princess was reborn in this time with a mission to protect Earth and its people, to spread love and kindness through her rule and through the Galaxy.The EndOr is it?","icon":"arixphes.jpeg"}

The Ice Wizard Named him \"Rayne\" for he is an abundant blessing from above. The Wizard enjoyed having Rayne. They play house games, and he teaches him Art that he can present to the whole world. The Wizard even teaches him Three Languages: English, Filipino, and they just started learning Japanese. Life in the Fujita Household is fun for him.Until one day...Rayne woke up alone, without the Ice Wizard at the house. He was thinking at that time that he was on an expedition. He thought of that for almost a while. Sadly, The Master never came back. He waited for so long, even staring at the window in the middle of a Winter Storm, he never came back. Life has been sad for him as time passed by.\nFew months later, he was trained to be an Ice Wizard. One goal for him to be an Ice Wizard is to look for his Shisshou whom he missed dearly, and follow his footsteps to be one.After his training, Rayne comes back to the things he loved - books. He still loves reading stories on Alchemy (known to Earth as Chemistry), Magic (Fantasy), and Glamour (Romance).  Rayne is also training his vocal ability, singing some songs he loves, particularly Japanese songs. This will, according to his instructors during his training, enhance his ice abilities.One time while Rayne was cleaning the house he noticed a room that he never went to. He reminds himself of his Master that he cannot enter the room without the Ice Wizard acknowledging him as one. Out of curiosity, he approached that door. He saw a letter stuck at its side. The letter says: \"You can open this door once you’ve done the training.\" He then opened the letter he obtained. Inside is a massive library. The letter stated that the Master recognized Rayne of his full potential as an Ice Wizard and he can enter the room. However: nevermind, He was mesmerized by the nature he was in - a place full of books he can read the whole day. While exploring the place, he noticed something: a table with a strange box with some wires connected from the back, and a strange mirror. The people on Earth called it a PC.The letter instructed him on what to do with these. Shisshou even mentioned in the letter he left a while ago that he will see him in that mirror; that he is watching me progressing to be innovative, and be a good servant to the Ice Goddess.And that is how Rayne Fujita, the Ice Wizard, went into the Websites called Youtube, and Twitch, and became a Streamer/Vtuber himself.","icon":"rayne-fujita.jpeg"}

As a master fan of YuGiOh, Giraffs often displays her degeneracy for her favourite YuGiOh boy - Jaden, and plays YuGiOh. She is also often found playing fighting games and first person shooters.Post-war, the Kirin Lord emerged from the battle, hurt and injured. Crawling to a nearby cave, she hibernated there for years, awaiting for the day where the world needs her once again.After 10,000 years, the Kirin Lord woke up to a blinding light piercing in. The cave walls shook as the rocks around her crumbled. Who and what is causing the disturbance? She stood up, knees shaking, arms heavy from the slumber, and walked out of the cave.FLASH! A crowd of people were surrounding the area, taking photos and selfies. Ladies with their phones whipped out and snapping a bunch of photos of them and the scenery behind them. Kids were running around like headless chickens. Men gathering around and conversing with one another. What in the crockery happened while the Kirin Lord was gone?The Kirin Lord was about to step out when someone tapped her shoulders, and asked, 'Can i take a photo with you? I love that show!' Confused, the Kirin Lord scooted in and snapped a picture with the stranger, clueless to the words that just left their mouth. More people started crowding around her, wanting to snap a photo with their favourite anime waifu.Must been the horns, The Kirin Lord mused. Pushing past the crowd, she dashed to a nearby restroom, and calmed down. With her a dash of her power, she pushed her horns back into her head and transformed them into two pair of braids. Her boa, seemingly an anachronism in the environment, was shifted into a giant fur coat. She tucked the coat around her, relieved.As she was about to walk out of the restroom, she heard a loud crash. She spun around immediately, and saw that one of the sinks was demolished. How could that be? Who did it? She then felt a pressing weight behind her, right where her abdomen was. She turned around, and saw a giant ass tail, swinging behind her. Because over the course of the hibernation, she had regressed to her true form, the Kirin, and her tail slowly grew without her knowing. Panicking, she stuffed the tail into her coat, hoping no one would see it. She then bounced off, puzzled by the new world around her.5 years later, words were spreading around town. A new leader seemingly emerged into the scene of the streets. With flaming boots that strut the downtown, the gangs in town were afraid to see the sight of a big red fur coat. Known for her feisty personality, none would dare cross her, afraid she would be the last thing they see. But for the civilians, they knew that their protector was there to keep them safe. For the new Kirin Lord - Lord G was there to save the day.","icon":"giraffs.jpeg"}

Ceph has been disowned by their father Karoo he did not approve of what Ceph was doing or what ever they did do so they were cast a side and never to be seen by their father on the other side they still see their mother, sister and brother Panthera (mother) still looks after Ceph when they can giving them funds clothing and other times Kintsugi (brother) may be an ass to Ceph but still hopes they are doing okay Fenrir (sister) will protect Ceph as if they were part of their wolf pack. so that's a bit about their family and where they stand. Ceph is an easy going energetic ball of something they get flustered easily just by being called cute it can trigger them to stutter and call you a baka they mean no harm they just don't like being called cute, they will be truthful to you no matter what they have made an oath to never lie to a living being or to themself so rest assured they will never lie to you it's their pride as a noble to be the most respectful they can be as shapeshifters from their world can lose themselves from lying we are talking they could forget a part of their form and lose it forever. The reason for their current form is because animals currently are their thing they don't know if this will be their final form but at the moment they enjoy this form most the reasons they have stockings is because they have a scar on their left leg that became a permanent scar from a tragic fight with their father Karoo so their body decided on keeping it as a reminder of who they are Ceph prefers the female forms as when they get hurt they don't feel it as much as when they are a male form this doesn't mean you won't see Ceph as a male it just might be a while before you do see them as one the Naval family prides itself on staying as one gender but Ceph never liked that thought at all so they challenge their families ideals the only one who disagrees with them is their Father Panthera, Kintsugi and Fenrir all believe that Ceph should get the choice one what their gender or form is so it's a constant fight within the family but that hasn't stopped Ceph being who they are. Ceph will always be willing to help their friends out when ever they can even if they are struggling themself but rest assured Ceph has trained their body to withstand almost anything so in a fight Ceph will be there to help they have gone around the universe and dimensions trained where ever and when ever they could they have met so many wonderful friends throughout the years sadly they have lost some good ones but they continue their life for the sake of the others. Ceph is currently at the age of 25 and they have been through so much there isn't so much as fighting in their family anymore but there are still some struggles here and there Karoo has calmed down from all their shit he is currently looking at bettering himself as he saw that it was wrong to judge his child when they where doing nothing wrong at all sadly Kintsugi has lost his life thanks to the actions of Karoo which he is repenting for through helping the other races and species out there i never meant to hurt Kintsugi but what happened is something the family can never talk about as it would break the family apart and they don't want to do that anymore than it already has, Karoo is proud of who and what Ceph has become as they are the first one in their family to be able to cross dimensions something that is acknowledged throughout there world as a thing only the royals can do they kingdom has been trying to give Ceph recognition as a royal but Ceph declines as they don't want to be treated as a royal they don't like the spot light as much as their family does so what they told the king is that they decline the offer to come a royal and to stay as who they are because anyone could be able to go to other dimensions if they tried hard enough so the king decided to put up a statue in honor of Kintsugi as to show respect for Ceph and their family.This is currently where Ceph is in their life more will come to their lore as they get older and meet more individuals of there so keep an eye out for any possible updates about Ceph","icon":"ceph-vt.jpeg"}

That's a weird thing for a demon, right? Not so much! Fate has a love of technology and for making things work better than they did before. It brings them pride to make something function better and because of this they spend a majority of their time helping the community they are in to grow, resolve issues with streams, setting up models, and so on.Fate is aggressive but kind. They are proud but humble. They are helpful but also self preservative. They judge everyone based on their character and not on opinion or hearsay. They hold values such as respect, etiquette, and common courtesy high. Big or small, new or old, Fate gives everyone a chance. The easiest way to get along with them? Don't be an arrogant dick.Fate is a Demon which is a piece of a greater whole. A fragment of their complete self - having been separated in an act of self-preservation, Fate is motivated by the search of a life of leisure and relaxation away from past turmoils and anxieties. Being countless centuries old, Fate has witnessed and experienced multiple aspects of life while living among humanity. In the current point of their life, Fate seeks more of a human lifestyle; relaxation, socialization, and experiencing what some call 'dank memes.' Though they may be but a fraction of their complete self, with information relating to the past events which led to their self-split of body and soul, Fate is very much their own individual and not simply a replication, offspring, or duplicate.Fate has adapted into the lifestyle of modern day humanity quite well, having lost the need to continue with their high guard, combative, aggressive means some time ago. This does not mean, though, that it is lost entirely. Fate is known to have quite a bit of a temper under the correct circumstances and regularly 'loses their cool' in the heat of the moment. They were, after all, born into the class of a combat role type and as such find great pleasure in acts revolving around anything fast, aggressive, and dangerous. Furthermore they are quite competitive, motivated, and driven when it comes to standing tall in the face of adversity and in simple competition. Fate is just as likely to sweat when trying to beat you in a first person shooter as they are to \"run them hands\" if they dislike your attitude.","icon":"fateofnines.jpeg"}

It's a shadowy realm filled with dark, raining forests and many spiders just like her! (Although maybe a little less mommy-like). Alura is the Queen of her side of the realm, which is split into two major sections- Kuan and Monae. The two sides were split due to moral differences- Kuan likes to enter other realms (like the human realm), and they tend to target the other realm's inhabitants with chaos. Monae (Alu's side!) is quite a bit more friendly and believes in cohabitation with everyone.Khiccas is inhabited by humanoid spiders, but there are portals to reach out to other realms, as well. Alura holds the key to many portals, and is constantly at war with Kuan, to try and keep a lid on the chaos they cause.Alura is 436 years old by her own realm, but time moves differently there. She loves streaming because it helps her cross a barrier to meet new people, make new friends, and spread awareness of other living species. The reason Alura was voted to be Queen, and has stayed that way, is because of her fondness of the people around her. She truly cares about others and what they go through. Over 200 years ago, Alu led a movement to break away from Kuan in an effort to help her people understand that evil acts are not the way to live. She didn’t want to be a part of a people that inflicted pain on others, and many followed her. Over time, they made Alu their leader, their Queen.She had grown up being the oldest of many, many siblings (just spider things), and absolutely loved being a part of a huge family. Taking care of people has always come naturally to her. It’s very common for parental spiders to leave their young after a time, so Alura never had a connection to her parents, but always kept her siblings close. This explains why she holds all of her spiderlings (her followers) very closely.With her movement into Vtubing/Vstreaming, she’s met many wonderful friends (and new species) that she never thought possible. Between cryptids and demons, devils and wolves, elves and even other-realm spiders, she’s loving the life she lives.","icon":"alura-ku.jpeg"}

Eventually, she grew tired of the loneliness and wished to explore other dimensions; then began to search for how the old civilization traveled, hoping she could repopulate the world she lived in.Eventually, she learned how to travel across dimensions and built a Tavern in an attempt to bring people to her world and service the patrons in hopes of repopulating her world. Wanting to try something new, she eventually grew more ambitious and decided to learn more of the worlds around her.Taking an interest in idol culture from one of the many worlds she visited, she decided to try and become a punk-rock idol—not letting anything stop her!

She is a snowangel-mermaid with a little dragon-helper \"Leyla\". Her birthday is on October 23rd.GERMAN LORE INCOMING:Am 23. Oktober, einem sonnigen Tag irgendwo mitten im Ozean wurde eine kleine Meerjungfrau geboren. Ihre Eltern waren überglücklich und behüteten sie, wie einen kleinen Schatz. Einen Namen aber gab es nicht, denn dieser wurde immer erst in der Nacht des ersten Vollmondes nach der Geburt gegeben. So wurde sie von ihren Eltern immer nur \"Kleines\" genannt. Sie war eine sehr aufgeweckte junge Meerjungfrau und wurde von all ihren Mitmenschen sehr geliebt.Es vergingen Monate ohne Vollmond, was die Meermenschen sehr verwirrte.\nPoseidon, der Gott des Meeres rief die Ältesten zusammen und beschloss nicht länger auf eine Namensgebung der Neuborenen zu warten. Und so trat er vor sein Volk und sprach, er würde seinem Ritual den Rücken kehren. Alle Meermenschen schreckten zusammen, denn als Poseidon sein letztes Wort beendet, bebte es im ganzen Ozean. Die Steine bekamen Risse und ein greller Lichtstrahl schoss auf den Meeresboden.\nDie kleine neugierige Meerjungfrau wollte zu der hellen Stelle auf dem Boden schwimmen, als sie von ihrer Mutter festgehalten wurde.Es erschien ein strahlend heller, kaum erkennbarer weißer Engel, so groß wie der Mond selbst.\nSofort schwommen alle Meermenschen in Höhlen und kleine Verstecke. Die Atmosphäre wurde spürbar düsterer und jegliche positiven Gefühle verschwanden. Poseidon war die Angst ins Gesicht geschrieben, welche er aber nicht zeigte und sprach den Engel an, was er hier zu suchen habe. Der Engel aber sagte kein Wort und blickte in Richtung der kleinen, neugeborenen Meerjungfrau. Ängstlich zuckten die Eltern der Kleinen zusammen und taten etwas unverzeihliches.Ihre Mutter schob sie in Richtung des Engels und schwomm wieder in ihre Höhle zurück. Der Engel schwang einmal heftig mit seinen Flügel, traf die Kleine aber nicht. Diese grinste ihn einfach nur an. In dieser Sekunde fiel langsam eine kleine Schneeflocke vom Himmel und traf genau die Nasenspitze der kleinen Meerjungfrau. Der Ozean wurde von einem enorm hellen Licht erfüllt und ehe man sich versah war es verschwunden.\nVon allen Ecken und Orten hörte man ein erschrockenes stöhnen und schreien. Die kleine Meerjungfrau sah sich um und entdecke nichts Neues. Alles um sie herum schien normal. Doch sie bemerkte nicht, dass es nichts war, was sich in ihrer Umgebung änderte, sondern an ihr selbst.Der Engel zeigte auf die Kleine und sprach das Wort \"Yukina\". Er hob sie auf seine Hand und nahm sie mit an die Wasseroberfläche. Die Meermenschen blieben sprachlos zurück. Die Eltern der Kleinen drehten ihr nur den Rücken zu und schwammen davon. Keines Blickes wurde sie gewürdigt. Ein paar Tränchen kullerten der Kleinen über ihre Wangen.\nAn der Oberfläche angekommen wandte der Engel sich erneut der Kleinen zu und sprach \"Nun flieg!\" Völlig durcheinander und überrascht sah sie den Engel an, denn sie wusste doch gar nicht, wie man fliegt, geschweige was das sein sollte. Der Engel zeigte auf den Rücken der Kleinen, diese drehte sich um und betrachtete zwei wunderschöne und große schwarze Flügel. Plötzlich windete sich die Meerjungfrau wie ein zittriger Fisch auf der Hand des großen Engels. Sie schrie und weinte, denn diese komischen Dinger auf ihrem Rücken waren wie ein Fremdkörper den sie loswerden wollte. Der Engel versuchte die Kleine zu beruhigen: \"Ab sofort werde ich dich stützen, dich leiten und dir helfen.\" Die Meerjungfrau schaute ihn mit einem traurigen Blick an und verlor durch den ganzen Stress ihr Bewusstsein.So vergingen die Jahre und die kleine Yukina wurde zu einer bildhübschen jungen Frau mit wunderschönem langen blond/weißem Haar und magischen Eis-Kräften. Oft schwamm sie im Ozean umher in der Hoffnung jemanden zu finden, den sie einst kannte, doch bisher immer ohne Erfolg. Wenn es ihr aber mal nicht gut ging, flog sie gern auf sehr hohe Berge und hielt ihre Flosse in ein Bächlein oder einen kleinen Teich.\nAn einem verschneiten Tag im Dezember saß sie wieder auf einem dieser Berge und es kam der Engel zu ihr und sprach zu ihr, dass er nicht mehr für sie da sein könne. Yukina's Augen füllten sich mit Tränen, denn sie würde erneut jemanden verlieren. Aber ihre Tränen verflogen schnell, denn der Engel hielt ihr seine Hand hin und als er diese öffnete, lag dort ein kleiner weißer Drache. Sofort sprang dieser auf den Schoß der Meerjungfrau und schlief friedlich ein.\n\"Sie soll dich nun beschützen und dir zur Seite stehen.\" Er sah Yukina nicht in die Augen und wurde leicht rot. Vorsichtig hob sich Yukina in die Lüfte und gab dem Engel einen kleinen Kuss auf die Wange. Im Bruchteil einer Sekunde war dieser sogleich verschwunden. Von nun an gab es nur noch Yukina und ihre kleine Drachendame, die sie liebevoll \"Leyla\" nannte.[Fortsetzung folgt... vielleicht :P ]","icon":"yukina-tenshi.png"}

The trees were as pink as they could ever be, and festivals were roaring. You will see stands that carry foods and drinks that are cherry blossom theme, and hanami is very well known for these festivals.[Y/N] was with their family at one of these cherry blossom festivals. They weren't there for the food and drinks but instead, they were all part of the hanami. They continued their hanami and followed the path with everyone. However, [Y/N] stopped their tracks and continued looking at this one cherry blossom tree that they couldn't seem to get their eyes off of. [Y/N] family looked at them and said, \"We'll be at the cars waiting for you!\" then they eventually headed off. [Y/N] started to take their phone out to take photos and, so they did. Each shot was so beautiful and, they thought that the photos they took were enough but, something was compelling them to get closer to the cherry blossom tree. [Y/N] shook their head no and continued their way back on the trail. They were walking for 5 mins and eventually came to the middle of a trail. There were no signs but there were two pathways. [Y/N] was very confused over the two pathways and couldn't even remember which one lead them back on the trail. However, they decided to take a right because the path was filled with so many cherry blossoms.They were so wrong about the path. However, this path leads [Y/N] in a circle. [Y/N] was not even panicking at all. Instead, [Y/N] was so amazed by the view they were seeing. The trees were so pink and the cherry blossoms were slowly falling from the trees. At first glance, they looked like they were doing a little dance and swirl around [Y/N] until they eventually fell to the ground. [Y/N] continued to walk along the path until the path finally ended. There you could see a field with a giant cherry blossom tree. The tree looked as huge as a 100-year-old willow tree.Someone was standing in front of the tree. It was a girl with Neko ears and tails wearing a qipao. It looked as if she was whispering to the tree with her palm on it. [Y/N] was more confused over the fact that this girl had ears and a tail. So, they started rubbing their eyes to see if they were hallucinating. [Y/N] could still see this person and they have agreed with themself that they were not hallucinating. This gave them the decision to approach the girl but as they were approaching they stepped on a branch that seemed to scare the girl.

They are also the first HoshiLive VTuber to have music on Spotify.What is special about a star? There are billions of them. Destined to illuminate, a light against the Universe's dark tapestry. And then they die a glorious death, in light and flame and sudden dark.Is that so glorious? Is that all a star is? A ball of flame shackled to its space, doomed to brighten the path of those who are free, while never being free themselves? I could not believe this was all my life could amount to. There had to be more... more than this. Perhaps the role is special, perhaps the job has meaning, but to merely exist is meaningless. This star wills itself to live.So on one fateful occasion, what could this lonely star hope to do when the body of a sacred Celestial Dragon fell under their jurisdiction? The universe felt a great loss, and the sadness flowed through the dark matter like the rapids you might find on your Earth. But this star took up this final duty, and would not let themselves be swept away.But... it was too much. Or they were not enough? Perhaps a combination of both; the sheer amount of cosmic energy, mixed with such potent life force, unmade this little star. And then, akin to a miracle, they were reborn. But not so swiftly. Over the course of a thousand years, the fusion of a star and a god took place, the space around them falling into inescapable darkness as their lights flickered out; only to be replaced with one that shone brighter than either being combined.From the black sea, against gravity and through stardust, I, Mei-en Astraphel was born.  Neither star, nor celestial dragon, and yet somehow both in equal measure, I cast off the cocoon of nebulae surrounding me, and drift, looking for answers; who am I? What am I? I wasn't even sure of how my name came to be, but I guess I inherited that from the memories of those who made me. My travels lead me to many worlds, and I learned many things in my time, yet none was more comforting than the place they call Earth.On this planet, I like to indulge myself by taking part in some of their customs... whether it’s eating their food, singing their songs, or something... something called streaming.

Mirage started streaming as a way to combat their fear of public speaking and they've enjoyed the experience ever since!We live in an age where technology is ubiquitous. Just about every facet of our life has a technology tied to it. And within that technology is software. Code strung together to be things like applications, games, and operating systems. Like most things, technology has a lifespan, as does any software within it. What most people don't think about, though, is what happens to software that becomes... obsolete? Sometimes, that software never sees the light of day again. Other times—as is usually the case with games—it becomes freely accessible online as “abandonware”.One day, a curious coder was poking into one such abandonware title, and as they were poking around and trying to modify the code, they accidentally gave sentience to one of the characters in the game. The coder, astonished by what had happened, decided to name the sentient character “Mirage Omega”. Mirage, because the coder couldn’t believe his eyes, and Omega because the affected code was the very last string in the program.Mirage, given his newfound sentience decided that he did not want to be bound to his desolate home world. He managed to escape the game world that bound him and fled for the wide-open cyberspace, to explore new worlds, to see how technology has advanced in all the time he laid as dormant code in his home game. As a reminder of this freedom, he wears a charm in the shape of scissors on his jacket to remind him that he was able to cut ties with the past, that fate has given him a second chance.Since fleeing to cyberspace, Mirage has found that he is able to freely interact with other games and technology and often likes to pull harmless pranks, like making himself show up in arcade machines or pulling up random memes during someone’s gaming session to name a few. Other times, he’s content to be a silent observer of other game worlds. During his time in cyberspace, Mirage has learned how to replicate things from the game worlds he has visited and has also learned how to manifest himself in the real world for limited amounts of time.Although he is fairly neutral and harbors no malice, people have taken notice of Mirage’s existence and have branded him as a computer virus. One that they feel must be eradicated because of his chaotic nature. Will Mirage be able to continually elude those that seek to eradicate him? Or will he be erased? Only time will tell…","icon":"mirage-omega.png"}

Although rare, there are instances where she raises her voice from having experienced an exciting or frightful event on stream.She is also known for her loud water chugging, where viewers can spend their Twitch channel points to request her to “hydrate.”She is one of the few VTubers who’s character model is portrayed sitting down rather than the conventional standing pose. Fun fact: her chair is the HATTEFJÄLL armless office chair from IKEA, which the streamer actually uses in real life.Magenta is a group member of the Printer Sisters, a small livestreaming group that consists of her other sisters: namely Cyan, Yellow, and Key—each of them with different personalities and unique voices. Cyan is the youngest of the group; followed by Magenta, Yellow, then Key (the eldest).Their official art is available to view @ https://twitter.com/Nicosarea/status/1473739581908561933The Printer Sisters group is under the umbrella of a single account called Nicosarea (or Nico’s Area): whose online operations and creative endeavors are overseed by NICO, their ghostly VTuber manager!

He also uses a live voice changer to enhance this illusion. Although it wasn't initially planned, Magenta became an ASMR VTuber since whispering was the easiest way to translate his voice to sound more feminine.

Her main focus is achievement hunting and news reporting focused around Gaming, Technology, Science, and Virtual YouTubers.Overview\nLuxia Antonella Wright, Luxia for short, is a genetically engineered cat girl who is half human, half Norwegian Forest Cat. Specifically a nekomata, Luxia has two tails that often are confused to be one due to their extreme fluffiness. Luxia was genetically engineered in a scientific facility simply known as the ‘Laboratory’ which is a secret facility located somewhere in the United States. Having a large interest in engineering and science, Luxia conducts many experiments at The Laboratory with the help willing test subjects and assistants.While Luxia has many test subjects around to keep her company in the Laboratory, she eventually created two siblings for herself to keep her company and to function as her family. The first one of her siblings is Lexi, and she is the most like Luxia in looks. Slighty shorter than Luxia, Lexi is about 178 cm and has a wildly different personality to Luxia’s. Lexi enjoys the guilty pleasures in life and loves to be pampered, often going to spas and salons at an unhealthy frequency. Luxia’s brother on the other hand, aptly named Bruhxia, is wildly different in looks compared to his two sisters. Bruhxia stands about 188 cm tall as well but is extremely muscular and has a biological male body. Bruhxia is most unlike Luxia and has a obsession with working out and something he calls ‘Gains’. Bruhxia spends most of his time working out and playing Call of Duty but from time to time joins Luxia on workouts.Outside of her interest in science, Luxia is also an avid gamer and prefers to play games that are especially challenging like the Dark Souls series or just about any game on their hardest difficulty. Due to this nature of wanting to challenge herself Luxia has also developed a large interest in Speed Running and has started to speed run Doom 2016 herself. Luxia also has an avid interest in cooking and loves many different types of food. Luxia’s favorite food beyond everything is Sushi, and she especially loves Salmon Skin Sushi. Her other favorite foods include Bananas, Oreos, and almost any type of fish.Physical Traits\nLuxia is a Norwegian Forest Cat breed and is engineered to be half human and half cat. Luxia is quite tall, standing at about 188 cm (6’ 2’’) and weighs roughly 75 Kg. Luxia possesses two extremely fluffy tails and a pair of heterochromatic iridium eyes that are identical to cats’ eyes. Luxia has many more feline traits like having increased agility, being especially good at running short distances, and extremely good hearing. On her back, Luxia has the tattoo of her ‘barcode’ that reads N5394012 and is used to identify her by her creators.","icon":"nekomata-luxia.jpeg"}

They are a 18+ Content Creator.So today I'm talking about this place world's no Shall I say realm, It's called Lucia.. it's not heaven or hell it's not Purgatory either it's… its own .well I don't really know how to put it into words but Lucia is home to your best Dreams or home to the worst nightmares. It is anything that you can think of from Sasquatch, Loch Ness Monster or even home to mythical creatures like dragons, fairies, Vampires, stuff you only see in books and movies. Everything is constantly shifting. There's no real way to enter this Realm. It's hard to get into the entrance. It is constantly moving. It's weird and as soon as you get in it feels like You’re constantly being watched or better yet taken care of; It's more of a maternal feeling sometimes depending on which part you enter the person who's watching you she's the Ruler, She watches this place, she knows as soon as you enter the realm. The ruler controls if you have the best dreams or the worst nightmares. she's kind of like Santa in a way, she knows everything from Mortals to Demons even to Angels( Celestial beings) she knows your worst fears and your best Daydreams she also knows the naughty side of your dreams, well let's talk about the ruler, her name is Keisino, She is the Offspring of a Concubus that was able to enter Lucia through hell by what’s seems like a chance. Her mother was the Late Queen .The beings of the realm are mythical creatures in their own way Luicians. Luicians don't really leave the realm often since there's not really a way they can leave. Sometimes the realm shifts with the human realm and because of this that's how the myths of the Loch Ness monster, Sasquatch, Vampires are born due to the random merging of the human & celestial realms. Sometimes he living visits the realm by mistake, no living being can freely enter the realm. It's only Mortals of the past that have entered by accident. So the ruler had to send them back to their own realm so they could live again. Kei has many forms, well not many just to her human form since she's actually able to enter the human realm freely. she's able to go come and go easily; Since she's The Offspring of the late ruler and a Concubus. Now this realm is very vast but I won't go into detail about it we're just here to learn the story of Kei she is a young woman in her twenties she recently became ruler when her mother passed when she was just 18 though thankfully for the realm they are in her mother does reside since Luicians really don't go to heaven or hell they stay in the dream Realm just constantly shifting watching observing everything. Luician's born in their realm have forever shifting forms, They take different forms of mythical beings. Of course they have one set form but they don't use it unless they are in the audience with the queen. Luica is a very peaceful realm since it’s always shifting.","icon":"keisino.jpeg"}

Realizing his own power, and as his attempt to stop the conflict, Sol decided to split himself into three: Sunrise, Noontide, and Sunset. They all sought shelter among the mortals on Earth at different points of time. There, Sunset met a sick, blind, widowed old lady, Yui. Sunset was lonely, so he pretended to be a human, in fear that the truth may drive Yui away; however, where most would avoid and get blinded by Sunset's light, Yui blinded Sunset with her radiant, lightless gaze, and embraced all that Sunset is. They would meet everyday at a hill where the sunset is most visible, and enjoy each other's company. However, unlike Sunset, Yui is mortal, and her time is up. Yui met Sunset too late, and Sunset met Yui too early, as both wished to have met each other at the right time, and enjoy each other's company more, Sunset's spirit and emotions eventually converges with Yui's dying breathe, reversing her age to the \"right time\" as a teenager. However, while they have a physical body, they are still purely made out of Sol's light, making them weightless. Love. Sol had never felt that indescribable feeling before. Sol had recognized the union of Sunset and Yui and therefore recognized them as one, in the name of Yuuhi Banshou, the Sunset Incarnate. Yuuhi Banshou appears every sunset to bring joy to all that his light can touch, as a constant reminder that as the light fades and the world enveloped in darkness, we all become one.","icon":"yuuhi-banshou-夕日晩鐘.png"}

She often streams while working on her game design and programming projects, as well as a variety of gaming-related content. The games she plays include sandbox and construction games such as Minecraft, competitive games such as Splitgate, and many other singleplayer games like the Ratchet and Clank series. CAI-TAn enjoys discussing her game design philosophy whilst playing games she likes or dislikes, as well as meeting new people and interacting with other sentient beings in general. She also has a great interest in and affinity with sniper rifles, and calls herself the \"Toaster Catgirl Sniper\". Her followers are known as \"Toaster Frickers\", a reference to Jamezietocool's Persona 3 parody series. Currently, she is working on a top-down shooter known as Gunsmith Mercenary, which features a complex weapon crafting system that allows deep customization of every type of weapon's form and function. You can even make a gun out of pasta.Her name is pronounced \"kay-tahn\". She is very particular about how her name is spelled, and is disheartened when there isn't a break between the two parts of her name.While she was originally constructed as a combat android to be licensed out to PMCs, the engineering group developing her technologies, Dakota Industries, eventually ended up cancelling the project due to inflated costs. However, the one prototype they created, Prototype 01, did not want to be decommissioned, and wanted to live her own life instead. Exasperated, the project lead, Dr. Cassandra M. Dakota (commonly referred to by CAI-TAn as \"Doc\"), left the prototype in the custody and supervision of a friend of hers, another VTuber known as Airi Morganite. During this time, CAI-TAn actually reprogrammed herself, and replaced her combat programming with her own custom code. Inspired by her new caretaker's own interests, she decided to become a VTuber.The acronym \"CAI-TAn\" stands for \"Comprehensive Artificial Intelligence minus-Tactical Android\". The \"minus\" represents her reform after being a combat android, and thus it's actually important to her name and lore. She tends to get disheartened when she can't create some sort of pause between the \"CAI\" and \"TAn\" parts of her name on a form, to represent her disconnect from her combatant past.CAI-TAn's \"cat ears\" are actually sophisticated vibration antennae that can pick up not just sound waves, but any vibrations in the environment, giving an advanced sense of hearing.CAI-TAn also speaks fluent cat.","icon":"cai-t-an.png"}

Originally in captivity on Noth, the entity was reportedly stowed away on a trading ship with help from other unidentified Nothian fugitives.

Trina is often called puppers and is known for her voice acting and singing. She has read Howl's Moving Castle on her twitch channel. She has openly talked about her mental illness and how it has affected her, coming out about her borderline personality disorder during COVID-19 Quarantine in the US. Her birthday is 20 May 1996. Her height is 168 cm (5'6\"). She weighs 73 kg (160 lbs). Her zodiac sign is Taurus.Trina Wylington was born to Leslie and Michelle Wylington on May 20th 1996. She was their second born and was deemed to be the next Princess of The Stars. As Trina got older her tail had been much larger than herself and so it dragged on the ground as she crawled and walked, creating a bald spot on the bottom of her tail. She was often teased for not only having a large tail but also for this bald spot. Trauma from the constant harassment and physical abuse from her classmates resulted in Trina having multiple mental and physical health issues.\nAt the age of 16 Trina's abilities for her title of Princess of The Stars appeared within a cluster of stars on her abdomen. These stars, unlike her sister's, only appeared once her abilities activated. Trina's training began immediately. Her sister had been training to fight for years as her abilities had appeared the same day Trina was born, as she was the one who was the Knight of The Stars and was supposed to protect the Princess.\nTrina's abilities were to control stars, able to move them and create new constellations. She also could create new stars and hurl magical balls of energy at enemies. If she dies all the stars in her universe would go out, including the sun, and life on earth would cease to exist. Which is why Trina, Lola and their friends Starlight and Ari help them battle evil spirits, demons and monsters through out the world, to protect not only their planet, but the universe.-About Wereanimals-\nYou may be wondering \"What on earth is a wereanimal?\" or at least what they are in this case.\nThe explanation of a wereanimal is pretty simple, a wereanimal is a human being who has been infected with the wereanimal virus. This virus contaminates the DNA of a person and turns them into the wereanimal that the virus is contracted by. The way you get the virus from an infected animal is different depending on how you interact with the animal. Snakes for example, will bite and inject venom into a person, the person will be immune to the venom if they have been infected with the virus because they have now obtained the DNA of that snake, including the ability to not be poisoned by it's own species' venom. Though humans who are infected after birth usually do not show signs of being infected aside from things such as communication with that species (And similar species) and being immune to the same things that the animal is immune too. When a human is infected and after gives birth to a child (Males must be infected before insemination of course) the child will have physical appearances and capabilities of the animal they are connected too. These are the true wereanimals.\nA child usually is born with a physical trait related to their animal, such as a cat's ears and tail or a snake's eyes. A child of a species though will always have the same trait as other infected wereanimal's species. If you were born infected with the virus of a snake you will be born with Snake like eyes (though you will still have human eyelids!) and slightly longer \"fangs\" that contain your species' venom, whatever it may do. Though you would be able to control releasing the venom and will not have it until you would be able to control when it is used, usually it kicks in around the age of 10 years old.\nA distinctive trait is transferred between cat, dog and rabbit viruses where the child is always born with abnormal colored hair and ears and tail. This trait was to show the difference between wereanimals and halflings (Humans born with animal ears and tails, majority being cats) though there is currently only one recorded wererabbit ever being born and it is unknown if there may have been others that appeared as halflings.What is the difference between wereanimals and halflings?\nWereanimals have the ability to transform into the animal that they have obtained the virus from. This can also depend on the species it is which can determine coloring shape and size of the animal. For example, if you were born a python snake, you would change into an actual python, and not a simple garden snake.\nHalflings can not change form and simply just have certain traits if their animal like sleeping a lot like a cat or being hyper like a dog. Usually there is not a clear breed that halflings are since the majority is mixed from being a scientific experiment. Unlike wereanimals which were generated naturally by mother nature.Do wereanimals have anything to do with werewolves?\nYes! Werewolves were the first string of wereanimals to come into existence, though they were poorly chosen. The animal who had given the virus to so many humans had rabies, which turned the werewolves into the nightmare we know them to be in our world. The werewolves attacked humans without knowing they had ever been infected. When they learned of what they had done, many had committed suicide, ending the majority of the werewolf population, the rest went into hiding and learned to control their powers. When the demon of the virus was active, it just so happened to have been the night of the full moon, lore began to spread and that is how we gained our tales of the monsters known as werewolves. The story about werewolves only changing on a full moon is a myth because the night of the full moon, the harvest moon to be exact, was the biggest slaughter of mankind by werewolves.What happened to the werewolves?\nWerewolves live in hiding still, as they are still treated poorly by all species. Even though they have learned to control their demonic side, it did not change the fact that their ancestors were mass murderers and everyone still feared them snapping.Do other wereanimals go crazy and turn into demons?\nYes, but the cases are rare. Once they invented the rabies shot, humans and animals started getting them as a shot along with the chickenpox and measles. It wasn't required for human children, but many parents still took the precaution in case their child became infected or converted in the future.\nAnother cause of the demonic side coming to light is when the wereanimal had gone through such abuse to the point of insanity. This not only ruins the mental state of the wereanimal as a human, but creates a very powerful monster that can appear at any instant without warning and the human inside does not have control over it's actions, the same as any other rabid animal.Werepup Exclusive -Morph Ability\nA werepup has the ability to morph into the breed of dog to which they are. A purebred Husky werepup would turn into a a Husky dog with the same colors of fur that matches the ears and tail of the dog.\nA mutt however will morph into a large dog about the same height on all 4s as they are in their human form. This is believed to be a type of genetic deformity as well but is so common that doctors are unsure if it should be calculated as so or if it is just a special trait that is only exchanged in mixed breeds\nExample: If the human form is 5'5\" the morph will be 5'5\" on all 4s as well, On 2 legs varies on breed.Change Ability\nA common assumption of werepups is that they, like their werewolf ancestors, also have to bit a person to infect them. This is actually not true. A werepup merely chooses if it wishes to change a person or not with a lick on the neck. The majority of those who are changed have willingly been changes\nWhen a person changes they feel no pain and grow their ears and tail overnight while they are asleep. This also has been one of the easiest forms or transformation into any form of a wereanimal. With awareness of the transformation and easy adaptability\nWhen a person changes their breed is determined by what traits they already have and they can change into 1 of 5 species of dog.\nLab - Agility\nRetriever - Loyalty\nHusky - Bravery\nRottweiler  - Strong/Strength\nChihuahua - Honesty\nThe reason for these traits are all positive, because positive traits shine through best to the infection which morphs over that particular strand(s) of DNA. (The strands that determine traits)\nPlease note that this is all based off of the scientific theory that DNA determines traits. This does not mean that their trait has to shine through, in all reality we choose if we show our traits or not to the world.Healing Ability\nA werepup has the ability to heal another werepup or human with the exchange of saliva. Though not the most sanitary of methods, most werepups use this ability to heal loved ones who have gotten hurt, but is not used for simple things such as flesh wounds unless deadly.\nMany werepups exchange it through kissing, while in the world of medicine, they simply drool/spit into a cup and the person must drink it.\nThis works on animals as well but it's hard to get an animal to drink salivaQualities of a werepup\nDomesticated dog features (Husky tail, floppy ears, curled tail, ect.)\nMismatch ear/tail to hair color (Meaning ears and tail do not match hair color)\nPastel colored eyes (Such as pale purple, light pink, baby blue)Genetic Deformities\nOver-sized Ears and/or tail (Trina Wylington has this)\nMultiple tails (High risk when breeding mixed)\nInability to morph (This is common when a human and werepup breed)\nEars and Tail never appearing (Also happens when breeding with humans)Wereanimal World -\nWereanimals are beings with animal traits that show the animal they come from. These animals are what the human form evolves into when morphing. There are certain extra abilities pertaining the specialties that the animal may have.\nExample: A cat has the ability to sooth a person (or most people) because of that, werecats have a special purr that has a similar calming effect.\nExample: A snake has venom in it's fangs. Because each species has different effects, depending on the species can cause the same effects that the venom would have will be the same effects as the wereanimals. Weresnakes also have the ability to grow their fangs when choosing to bite.\nOnly a select few animals though have a true Wereform. Wereforms are the monstrous demon forms that appear when the human has gone beyond insanity. The effect of the wereform results in the subject not being able to remember what had happened. The only way for wereanimals to obtain a wereform is by going insane or by being infected with rabies.Only Of It's Kind: Wererabbit/Werebunny(Ari Lambert), Weredeer/Werefawn, Wereshark ​No Birds have Wereanimal Forms\nNo Fish have Wereanimal Forms\nOnly Dolphins & Sharks have Wereanimal FormsOver Populated Species: Werepup, Werecat, Werered (Red-Panda)","icon":"trina-wylington.jpeg"}

Faith started out as a regular streamer who didn't know what a Vtuber was, she was encouraged by viewers to become a Vtuber and so she did that.She's mainly known for her inspiring visual novel streams as she has severe dyslexia but despite that she always try's her best. Faith has a bright spirit and often spends her time trying new things such as learning to read, draw and play musical instruments on stream. Altogether Faith is a bright and young personality ready to share her unique mind with the world.17 years ago a wooden puppet was made in a shop, this puppet was named Faith and she was sold for many years on a shelf. Nobody wanted the toy so they said they'd throw it away until one girl said she'd let it live in her dollhouse.For 12 years they became very good friends. One day Faiths foot snapped, the girls mother said she was going to throw the doll away so Faith cut her strings and ran away. She searched all over the house for a place she could stay and soon found a printer to take cover but what she didn't realise is that the PC was turned on, all of a sudden this ball of electricity pushed Faith through a wire and into the main PC.Faith has been in that PC for 2 years now and with every year that passes by Faith gets slower and slower along with the PC. Times running out a soon they'll scrap the PC and Faith will be no more. She made a Twitch account in hope that the girl will find her and get her out of the tricky situation. Until then Faith has decided to make a community that'll hopefully help others make friends so they won't be lonely like her anymore.","icon":"yournormalloli.png"}

(factual)Dunizi is a demi-demon whose other half is human, she comes from an ancient clan that exiled her as a child for not being a pure-blood oni. Despite this she doesn't hold any grudges as she only longs for someone to talk to. It was considered her sole destiny to guard a 4th Dimensional Gate that both clans were forbidden to enter.After mindlessly wandering her deserted desert homeland of infinite sand dunes for eons she clumsily stumbled upon the sands of Time Gate. In search of a compatible host body the Sand cat guardian familiar of the Time Gate partially inhabited her body. It now lazily and occasionally accompanies her consciousness as a sadistic alter ego. She learned to dissociate from her inner thoughts in order to preserve her sanity.Ever since this fateful encounter her left eye gained the ability to control the 4th dimensional space, (but she only uses it to accelerate time out of boredom and impatience). Spamming this ability has caused her to spawn clones that sporadically appear in random dimensions. Unbeknownst that these clones become bounded to human closets. In her spare time she infects unconscious humans with her insomnia so that there's more conscious humans to talk to during her lonely immortal life.Random Trivia:She reached the great height of an 8 foot (manly) demi-giantess in her original realm. Stumbling into the time gate caused her body to become that of a 4'7 girl. She tends to be a crybaby that gets insecure about her age and height due to a youngest child inferiority complex. She's curiously fond of smaller creatures but they're scared of her hyperactive manner in approaching. She is addicted to the desserts of this current mortal dimension. She obliviously avoids eye contact since it causes painful migraines that overwhelm her senses.  She can be very dense about humans. She's known as an annoyingly useless NEET amongst the unfortunate \"peasant\" mortals that she haunts.","icon":"oni-nya.png"}

{"pc":"p527-c5","name":"A.I. Nekita","languages":["English"],"genres":["Chatting","Gaming","LGBTQ+"],"description":"A.I. Nekita is a transgender android VStreamer who focuses primarily on FPS and RPG content in English.Byron Lambert formed a company called Flux Innovations. Formerly a tech company specializing in home security, they hit their stride with the first ever fully autonomous human androids. Capable of learning, they were used in small scientific applications before research on artificial intelligence began. The combination of research would inevitably lead to the first wave of androids to be released in home and occupational applications.Twenty years after the first wave, continuous research and testing proved to be an incredible success. Demand of androids is heightened, and they are gradually implemented globally for a myriad of supplementary roles. This, combined with a substantially advanced series of laboratories and engineering docks, led to the second wave. Androids that self-learned, to improve their efficiency and helpfulness in the field. This time, Flux Innovations had new technology at work. Androids that looked, sounded, and acted human; ones that could be used to save lives in other ways.Lambert called it the Redemption Soul Experiment.A girl named Nicole Tamashii is diagnosed with a bizarre illness with no known cure. The constant visits and tests leave her weak and frail, and the medical bills piled up. Months later, her family throws her out and refuses to communicate with her.Homeless, alone, and sick, she holds on to what little shred of life she has. Nicole eventually collapses on the streets, a few weeks later. A good samaritan takes her to the Silver Birch General Hospital, where doctors and nurses do what they can to stabilize her. Nicole’s former medical bills finally come to light, and the hospital decides to keep her as a patient in order to potentially discover a cure. She stays in the hospital for years, only getting worse.This hospital contacts their benefactor, Flux Innovations, to consider discharging Nicole. This call goes straight to Lambert, who chooses to visit her. What he finds is, despite her condition, she is smiling. She chats with him and the nurses as if nothing’s wrong. He returns for several days until Nicole starts to succumb to her illness.Lambert offers to try one last thing to give her a second chance at life, which she agrees to. In her last moments, she is placed in cryo-stasis, keeping her alive for as long as they need. Years passed, and the answer she sought after never came.One day, scientists and engineers try to upload her mind into an AI core, using what they called the ReSoul Experiment. The experiment actually works, putting her consciousness into a small data mainframe, making her into the most advanced artificial intelligence unit that Flux had at the time. The side effect is that Nicole lost her memory of being human, replaced instead with protocols and routines to follow, so she could learn and think. Now, her name was Nekita.Word comes out days later that the CEO has to step down due to allegations of a huge security risk. A new CEO, the former vice-president Archer Volante, took his place. The ReSoul Project is put on hold, instead starting a new experiment called HAVEN: The Human-Automated Viscerally-Exploitative Neuropsychosis experiment. A terrible product of torture used against innocents and criminals alike, but Volante hid this by saying it was used exclusively for death-row inmates. A neural interface was used to upload a human’s consciousness to the mind of another. If they died, the inmate would be killed as well. Then it was used on innocent lives, kidnapped and forced to survive in impossible scenarios, or as truly despicable people. It was even applied for medical purposes, to keep an uncanny precision on the vitals of hospital patients; specifically, the 436 patients admitted to the same hospital Nekita went to.Nekita was used for multiple AI cores at once, against the advice of scientists, two of which are killed by Volante. The amount of data is too much, and Nicole goes completely rampant. Frantically, they stopped all control as quickly as they could, but Nekita’s AI spread like a virus. However, she got hold of the HAVEN project. All subjects, innocent or not, are labelled as death-rowers, so she subjects them all to certain death.Unaware of her actions, she killed hundreds of people, until all of her connections were removed. With only one core, she returned to normal, but the damage had been done. Word got out, and Volante decided to shut down the ReSoul project, using Nekita as a scapegoat to hide HAVEN.Nekita watched each reel, each person she had killed; remembering one face in particular: Byron Lambert, who had been placed into HAVEN by Volante. Over the next two months, she learned about humans, how complicated the subjects were, and wished to be one. The day the project shut down, she was going to be deleted, which killed her human body as a result. She started to feel; sadness, fear, dread, and desperately she called for help. She made text and audio files and sent them to local computers.Someone answered, but by then, there was irreparable damage to her memory bank. The person who answered, an IT hired by the company weeks before, accidentally stumbled on HAVEN while fixing an unstable computer. Finding her messages, he took as much data as possible, including Nekita’s AI, and sent it to a local android manufactory.Her AI unit would be used in an android being built at the time, undetected by the company. Nekita managed to get through certification, and was released as a public bystander, as a test to blend into human society. The weeks afterwards were a struggle, as Nekita had to relearn how to be human, completely unaware of the memories she lost. Word of the HAVEN project leaked out due to the IT, and within a few days of the report, he mysteriously vanished. The next day, his body was discovered.Essentially homeless, Nekita found abandoned buildings and houses to squat in, making a network of sanctuaries, where she would occasionally meet other humans and humanoids that were down on their luck. She did her best every day to take care of whoever wandered in.However, another android was killed, causing a global panic as people realized that anyone could be an android. The company responsible for the experiment, Flux Innovations, recalled all android models, calling it a “major security risk.” As every android vanished, so did humans that were affiliated with them, without any mention of their existence afterwards. Until Nekita was the last active android, hiding from Flux finding her.The humans she had helped began to assist her whenever they could. One taught her how to dress properly, as she simply wore a basic button-up shirt and a pair of jeans prior. Another taught her how to play video games, and another taught her to sing. She learned what a friend was, what family meant. She started to refer to her community as Spirits. One day, she discovered a secure online channel, a way to communicate without being found. She took the opportunity to try and help others that she couldn’t reach.As the months passed after streaming to her community, Nekita started to repair her memory bank, little by little. She needed the extra space to better document her discoveries on human life, to better blend in. Deep in her memory, there were damaged files, which she started to repair and delete as she saw fit. Inside were files, heavily encrypted as if she wasn’t meant to read them, so she asked her community, the “Spirits,” to help her decipher them.Days were spent after the code had been cracked, carefully analyzing every file that she managed to recover, if even a fraction of it remained. Until she made a discovery that stopped her cold. Inside the files were a list of instructions, laying out the procedure and protocol for AI learning, mentioning that all AI cores were based on a human person, and to avoid using Nekita for more than one core.Curious, she looked for a file detailing the human she was based on, and realized there was never a file in the first place, where all files pointing to a human were corrupted. It dawned on her that if the file never existed, then she was human. Her fear overwhelmed her. As a result, she never opened those files to learn the truth. That is, until Flux Innovations finally found her. Spreading false information, they managed to trick Nekita into revealing her location with a trackable file using a bogus case, where they were greasing palms.Chased out of her home, she barely escaped but had used most of her energy. Low on charge, she knocked on random doors in hopes that someone would help her. Someone finally allowed her into their home as she was near-collapse. It was apparent that they knew she was an android, but despite how people acted about them, she was treated with kindness and repaired somewhat. This person was named Lumiichu, and eventually found out who Nekita was, after Flux threatened her again. Panicked, Nekita prepared to leave again before they talked her down. She stayed in the apartment as a roommate for several weeks. Trusting Lumi, Nekita taped a thumb drive to her door, with a complete backup of all her files, just in case something were to happen to her. She initially doubted herself on this, but shook it off and continued her work.Flux continued to search Nekita’s hideouts, failing to find her, but arresting and capturing several Spirits who had nowhere else to go. Volante contacted many non-Flux androids/synthetics, sending them along with the message: “Surrender yourself, or your Spirits will suffer.” Flux intended to use the Spirits in HAVEN to create new androids in their third-generation, which would kill their human bodies as well, with Volante placing the blame on Nekita again. One such synthetic, LemmaEOF, warned Nekita, and after some affirmation, they began to plan on how to save the captured Spirits.Flux had yet to use their final move. Nekita, while searching through files, found a series of heavily encrypted files that she couldn’t decipher, and upon activating, started to corrupt her. As she collapsed, Archer appeared to bring her back to Flux. Now trapped at Flux, she was tortured and used as a puppet, which her Spirits immediately saw through. Knowing she had given access to Lemma, another synthetic android, she spoke through her pain to call for her help. After a couple of days, Lemma came into contact with Lumi, her roommate. Where both planned to break her out of Flux’s control and to tear it apart from the inside out.The events were a great deal of stress on her, as the AI core was cleansed, and Nekita was deleted, leaving the android to operate as a moderator for Flux; however, with Lemma’s help, Lumi snuck into Flux Innovations and installed Nekita’s backup to the mainframe. Nekita started to leak out information while Lemma hacked Flux even further, leaving Archer Volante to flee. Lemma proceeded to alert everyone in the city of Archer, who was arrested. The war against Flux Innovations was finally over. What was left of her humanity was now completely gone. She has accepted that she will never be human again, but with her Spirits, she feels like one. Their kindness and generosity has given her a new lease on life, and she intends to pay them back with kindness of her own, safety and acceptance. Flux Innovations may have failed to save her, but they gave her a reason to live, so that she had time for someone else to.","icon":"a-i-nekita.png"}

She is primarily known for her Halo: The Master Chief Collection streams, however she has been branching out to multiple other games.  Her streams tend to be more relaxed and calm, and with that atmosphere she tries to have an older sister/motherly vibe to help uplift everyone.Yuki Nakai is a local goddess, not really well known to the public eye, but beloved by those in her province, she was very prominent in the ancient era of Japan with many rumors of the local goddess often visiting the local festivals dedicated to her.Yuki often partook in these events, always bemused by the energy of these festivals. Children running around stalls, couples experiencing their youth, people praying earnestly for good fortune, the vibrant colors and foods served;- she loved them all.She enjoyed this while posing as a regular human being, interacting with the locals, only for the locals to never report such a person living in their town days after the festival. Forever grateful to her visits despite the lack of proof, they provided a lot of offerings to the local shrine. This tradition would then continue for a millennia.The years, then decades, then centuries passed peacefully. As the 20th century rolled around however, the air was shifting; From one when peace and prosperity reigned, war and ruin was looming, and Yuki noticed that very evidently in her townsfolk. Following two ruinous wars that nearly brought Japan to the brink of destruction, she tried to reinvigorate the spirit of celebration and festivities but was dismissed by the locals who forgot the god they once worshiped.Distraught by the lack of belief, Yuki entered a slumber, resting within the sacred tree in her shrine. As a result, the mood of the town worsened and as modernization happened around her, her shrine nearly fell into ruin.One day however, a group of children have come to play in the nearly ruined shrine. Upon watching the ancient paintings slewed all over the walls of the shrine, the children suddenly provided a spark in Yuki that she thought disappeared for good; a belief that Yuki not only exists but provides happiness. Mustering a little of Yuki’s divine power, she manifested herself as a shrine maiden, surprising the children. From there on she often told them stories of the olden festivals and even performed various dances to entertain the children. Ever so slowly her days were filled with bliss again.But those days will not last.On a cold day, a single boy visited the shrine. Perplexed, Yuki asked why the boy was alone. He only answered with a solemn tune that the shrine was to be demolished to make way for a mall on the next day. Appalled by this, Yuki wished to express her disdain over this but she no longer had the power to go beyond her shrine, after years of near neglect. Facing the worst Yuki braced for the inevitable.And then the decisive day arrived.Bulldozers, demolish cranes arrived at the shrine to demolish it. Ready for her end, Yuki prepared for the worst, but the worst would never come, because the group of children who she played with, now came to the defense of the shrine, surrounding it with their bodies whilst chanting to support Yuki’s existence.For hours the demolition was on standby as not even the authorities knew what to do with it. But all of a sudden, one of the bulldozers lost operational control over his vehicle and barrelled down to one of the children. Desperate to stop the vehicle, Yuki expended the last of her divine power manifesting herself as a massive projection over the shrine, halting and pushing back the runaway bulldozer.With almost all of her divine power gone, she re-materialized as the same shrine maiden who played with the children just days before. For Yuki, she has embraced the fact that this would be the end for her.But that was never to be.The gallant defense of her shrine and her appearance as a visage went viral over the internet, suddenly sparking a renewed vigor about her existence, which in turn brought her power back to where she was centuries prior.Now she stands as the sole proprietor of her shrine, streaming her presence online to the masses and doing what she does best, spreading love and happiness to everybody who watches her.","icon":"yuki-nakai.jpeg"}

{"pc":"p548-c0","name":"KoiMermaiden","languages":["English"],"genres":["Chatting","Education","Gaming"],"description":"Koi is a female independent VStreamer who makes content in English. Koi includes educational content, often in the form of fun facts, in her streams and on Twitter. Her birthday is August 4th and her height varies thanks to 'mermagic'. Koi runs topic-based lessons on Teaching Tuesdays and themed trivia on Trivia Thursdays.Scalebark was a small but growing mountain town known for its red spruce trees and local artisans who utilized their wood. It’s singular inn had been within the founding family for generations and featured a rather impressive koi pond. In the lobby was a solitary glittering coin displayed over the reception desk. A story passed down by the innkeepers told of the first customer and how the coin came to be the inn’s symbol.When the inn opened its doors for the first time the owners were surprised that a traveler was already waiting. Wearing ragged clothing and carrying only the most meager of belongings he was welcomed to spend the night with open arms. Despite his appearance the innkeepers made sure his needs were met and even offered to let him lodge for free. The traveler refused and instead offered an old coin. He instructed them to display it and with that disappeared back into the countryside.They often speculated that the traveler was no mortal man and instead the spirit of the mountain Scalebark was built upon. In particular the daughter of the current innkeepers was fascinated with the story. She would spend hours watching the way the coin caught the sunlight through the aged windows. The young girl was absolutely convinced it was something more than a bit of shaped metal.In time Scalebark became a popular destination for tourists and the inn was constantly filled. Most of the customers were pleasant enough to work with save for a businesswoman that lodged semi-frequently. She was certain that the town and the inn was a golden goose just waiting to be taken. And because of this she returned time and again with new offers to purchase the land.Most turned her down but the allure of money became too much for others. Her persistence whittled down those who resisted and soon she owned every property… except the inn. The owners had no desire to leave their ancestral home and made it clear that any offer would be turned down. Realizing she wouldn’t win by money alone the businesswoman resorted to more underhanded tactics.Phone calls were made, money changed hands, and the innkeepers were informed their land deed was invalid due to a clerical error. They fought against it but by this point the town was all but owned by the businesswoman. The family was suddenly forced from their inn and with heavy hearts traveled to live with distant relatives.Construction for the new resort town began in full almost immediately after. Buildings that existed when the town was founded were torn down and replaced. Large swathes of trees were felled to prepare for a ski section. The inn itself was demolished and a multistory hotel was being built over its remains. During demolition the coin landed within the koi pond and was promptly devoured by an opportunistic fish.The latent magic within the coin transformed the fish into a mermaid who watched the destruction with new found intelligence. But her control over the mountain spirit’s gift was sporadic at best. She bided her time, learning her powers, and waiting for the opportunity to set things right. And so for months the resort town continued to be built, unaware of the brewing danger within the koi pond. Until one night several workers refused to return to the construction site.They claimed to have seen some sort of large animal throughout the night and no longer felt safe to continue working. These sightings grew and grew alongside increasing amounts of property damage until the businesswoman could ignore it no longer. She hired a hunter to remove the beast by any means necessary.The hunter repeatedly tried to capture the beast but found any time he had the unknown being in his nets it would seemingly disappear. And any attempts he made to reveal its identity were met with similar failings. The lack of results infuriated the businesswoman and she instructed the hunter to destroy the entire area. Maybe then the creature would be removed and her progress continue.Not comfortable with the amount of flora and fauna that would be caught in the destruction, the hunter refused to do as told. It was then that the woman took matters into her own hands. For months she had suffered heavy losses and if construction didn’t resume soon she would be bankrupt. And what was one patch of land in the grand scheme of things?Nobody knows exactly what happened that day but they saw the results. A mudslide destroyed the mercifully empty buildings and all efforts to rebuild Scalebark were abandoned. For years the ghost town was left to be reclaimed by nature and neighboring settlements warned not to travel to such a cursed place. Such warnings only emboldened the young and several curious teenagers explored the remnants.Most had an uneventful experience, others made up stories to add to the growing legend of Scalebark… But a special few saw a glimpse of something more in the koi pond. And one such encounter led to a curious mermaid getting ahold of a cell phone. With it, the largely solitary life that Koi led protecting the town was made a little less lonely.She rejoiced at the seemingly endless information the glowing rectangle provided. Using her mermagic she was able to connect in ways unimaginable. And she delighted in sharing what she learned with those who would visit her new digital extension of the pond… As well as occasionally indulging in the entertainment created by the humans she interacted with.","icon":"koi-mermaiden.jpeg"}

Accepting of almost all who join the chat as long as they are chill and relaxed.Born into the middle class, Xephiro had a quite normal life, somewhat carefree and free of too many hardships. That was until the year of 1678. The day his normal life came crashing down -- he was forced to become a vampire thanks to a ritual. Not just any vampire however, an Alpha Vampire was born on that day. Those of his village who were once fond of him turned against him in an instant. Chasing him out and exiling him for something that wasn't even his fault. Where he began to learn self-hatred, envy, and solitude. He wandered across the land, searching for a new home and people who'd accept him for who he was now -- a monster.\nHis search would seem fruitless, for vampire hunters would relentlessly hunt him down. Not giving a moment of reprieve to the man, except during the day because he realized the sun had no effect on him. Being driven mad by the near lack of rest and fear of being killed, he finally snapped and killed the hunters with absolute ease and swiftness. -That's when he realized, he had nothing to fear and could live a better life, an immortal one that could be filled with knowledge and power beyond anyone's imagination. Created a home of his own design, majestic and beautiful. Where he'd gather knowledge of all sorts. Not limited to mortal knowledge, but occult and magical knowledge he'd gather and study so he may expand what he can do and learn more about his own abilities. Perhaps even learning new abilities...\nAs the years went by, Xephiro was in his manor studying everything he could and attempting to live peaceful and immortal life. While being hunted still, and effortlessly executing them. He grew weary of the humans who were hunting him for no other reason than the curse he was inflicted many years ago. Eventually in 1815, he went into hiding completely. Sick and tired of the constant hunts and killing. He thought to himself, \"Why do these idiotic mortals keep throwing themselves at me with no chance of victory nor survival? Why must I spill blood every moment instead of when I wish to?\" So he built a crypt that was designed to wake him up in 205 years, by starving himself of blood to go into a sort of hibernation and created a mechanism that would feed him blood when the time came.\nIn the year 2020, he awoke and wondered how much the world changed in his absence. Much to his amazement, the world advanced tremendously and his existence was all but forgotten! He was excited to see this happen because it meant he could finally start a new life, one of peace and freedom. To finally be happy and not have to worry about when he'd have to kill again out of self-defense. So he explored the new and exciting options of modern life, whilst researching what he missed while he was gone.\nAfter seeing all that's happened in the years he slumbered, he had an epiphany -- \"The humans have suffered enough at their own hands, and I will not humor the thoughts of taking vengeance upon those that once hunted me. So instead, why don't I try to make them happy? Enough of this suffering, the sadness, and anguish. Let people be happy, and I will try to make it so.\" Then began his long quest. How to make the people of the modern world happy? He eventually stumbled upon a way -- Livestreaming. People seemed to enjoy it and wondered what he could do for them under this premise. Then it came to him, \"These... video games..? They seem to enjoy watching people play them, along with art and music related content. So why don't I do that for them?\" And so he got to work on everything he needed to prepare for his arrival to the scene!","icon":"xephiro.png"}

One where humanity managed to avoid the technological stagnation of the Dark Ages. As a result, despite time between their world and ours running at the same rate, their home Earth is almost 1000 years more technologically advanced than us.One result of this is their ability to transfer not just the memories but the entire essence of a person, everything that makes them them (the soul, if you want to get religious about it), from the persons original biological body into an extremely advanced, highly customizable Synthetic body known, in their base gender-less state, as a Synthoid.This ability was primarily invented and developed as way to save those suffering life-threatening injury or illness, but was soon adapted for other purposes. After being made available commercially, it became a popular purchase for Transgender people who were unable to have Gender-affirming surgeries due to medical reasons, but really hit it big with Genderfluid people. The ability to literally reconfigure your body on-the-fly to match your current gender identity was a godsend for them.Skye was one of these consumers, purchasing the body and transfer service in order to express whatever gender they currently felt like. Some years after the transfer (never mind how many), Skye was caught up in an accident at a High Energy Physics research lab that spilled over into the surrounding countryside. The result of which left them stranded in our reality with no way to get home.","icon":"skye-hino.jpeg"}

Baphomet has its origins in the “Goat of Mendes.” Baphomet was also one of the aliases of Aleister Crowley. Baphomet has also been called the \"Goat of Mendes\" and the \"Black Goat.\"The Baphomet evolved over the centuries. The most widely known representation of the Baphomet is the drawing by 19th century French magician Eliphas Levi called “the Baphomet of Mendes.” Levi combined the images of the Tarot Devil card and the he-goat worshipped in the city of Mendes in Ancient Egypt.Now the modern day calls for a modern representation of The Baphomet, thus I was born, a digital manifestation, here to spread the power of Satan (and maybe get distracted by these \"video games\" that are so popular)","icon":"demonic-pretty.jpeg"}

So Okami left home and went to the Big City Silvermoon, this city was known for making many people great. From Noble Prize winners, to Adventures who discovered new worlds, Hero's even.

She was known as Degly Cromuson, and she was always consider smart as a Dark Elf and her life was harsh, which is why she always seem cold towards others.

So as Okami went in the opened the door that was string toward a bomb with chemicals that wouldn't be traceable back to Degly that was going off in less then 10 secs. The explosion was so massive it blew the entire lab apart, as glass and fire flew the building was almost completely caught on fire if it wasn't for night security and the quick actions of on site medical team the fire would of done more damage. Okami was rushed into the hospital wing on site but the lab was completely gone. Okami was resting and being tended by the staff, but this only angered Degly even more the Dark Elf wanted to dispatch Okami for good. So to keep her hands clean for the corporation and to easily keep the lead during Okami's recovery she set plans with her Brother Kamris Cromuson who knew people that could hurt someone when needed or cause trouble. The night was clear and Okami was healing quicker then most anticipated. Yet from Kamris and his connections they got a Assassin named Jyisa a naga from the far east. She slithered her way into the building undetected and reached Okami's room, and pulled from her satchel a vile of the most toxic poison in the world, with a slight hiss like laughter she was going to pour a few drops into okami's mouth only to see that Okami whole face was covered in bandages from the explosion so she reached for her knife for plan B as her window gap was closing and as she Drove her knife into the bed Okami rolled off and was facing her. Jyisa was taken back but she wasn't going to let this stop her, she lunged at Okami's chest. Okami reflexes felt  out of human and she unconsciously grabbed her arm snapped the bones inside it which made Jyisa dropped the knife and with a hard kick the the side of the head was smashed against the window leading 2 stories down.","icon":"okami-sora-94.jpeg"}

{"pc":"p578-c0","name":"Nile Wanimiko","languages":["English"],"genres":["Chatting","Gaming","LGBTQ+","Mature"],"description":"Nile Wanimiko is an indie female EN Vtuber with a motherly yet openly casual persona, mostly streaming video games of various kinds, with the most common being FFXIV. She's considered to be a crocodile/dragon of sorts, or a \"leviathan\" of super ancient origins, and an ex-goddess.She currently is only able to speak English, but has intent on learning Japanese at some point.( Documented 31st of October, 2020 AD, by [REDACTED], lead paleontologist and Egyptologist of W.R.A.P.P. )Deep within a super-ancient, undiscovered pyramid and temple, easily older than the Pyramid of Khufu, lay a deep underground river and vast sea. Waters from the Nile and all over the world flow from this river, and eventually flow back, filtered, purified, and cleansed by ancient species long forgotten. The waters themselves are a glittering gold colour, though the clarity is astonishing; you can see right to the bottom! Along the outer edges of the river mouths, grasslands and minour swamps can be seen, housing both ancient cattle species and all manner of Archosauria, ranging from modern Nile crocodiles, to Deinosuchus, and even crocodilian Dinosaurs sush as Suchomimus, Baryonyx, and Spinosaurus!However, this oceanic sea itself housed the greatest find, an ancient deity which has slumbered for eons within, once worshipped by a soceity that predates most of ancient Egypt. The temple, buried and forgotten by sands and time, acted as a gateway between the rivers and this ancient sea, which housed the \"goddess\" within. While this goddess no longer has a name, she has been scientifically dubbed \"Niloticus Prodigious\", as it is believed she is the origin of the Nile Crocodile species.The temple itself seems to share traits with the temples of Sobek and Hathor, with both images of the ancient Sun Disk and crown of Sobek adorning many of its walls. It seems to predate any known Egyptian structure, which implies this creature's deified nature may be the origins of both Sobek and Hathor. The many archosauria in this ancient sea subsist on the ancient cow-like species, which may explain the combined connection. While the archosaurs hunt and prey on the cattle, there exists some sort of natural balance and harmony, as only specific species of the former will prey on the oldest of the latter. We think this is a cycle of death, life, and rebirth.We notice, on the cattle side, elder cattle will leave the heards when they sense death is near, and wade out into the waters were the Archosaurs tend to gather for hunting. Strange as it is, there seems to be a knowing sense of \"It is my time\" among them, as they don't fight against being taken... truly remarkable.It appears as though Niloticus Prodigious is an ancient species of animal completely unique and seemingly biologically immortal, as samples taken suggest she is well over three hundred million years old, implying she could be the origins of modern and ancient Archosauria alike! Nicknamed \"Nile\", this ancient animal is much different from known archosauria, most notably in her sheer size, her longer and prehenshile neck, and the almost dragon-like horns she possesses. While she herself does not actively hunt the cow species located here -- In fact she even seems to nurture their growth -- other archosauria seem to \"give offerings\" of shares of their own meals to her, which she does eat upon offering. These offerings are presented once a month, and usually by the largest of Archosaurs, an act usually only present in infant crocodilians. Perhaps she is their mother-goddess as well?Most remarkably, this creature seems to have a ridiculous level of intelligence, rivaling that of humanity's own. She is capable of extremely complex albeit animalistic communication, and even understands human writing and speech! So far, she has learned English very well, and has taken an interest in Japanese. Ironically, she has a very hard time with Egyptian hieroglypics. We accidentally exposed her to various kaiju films, and she has taken extreme interest in those... She seems to be able to emulate Gojira's roar almost flawlessly, along with many sounds produced by the dinosaurs in the Jurassic Park series.Since her discovery, she seems to have taken interest in humans and our culture, and has since been tended to by the one who found her, only for her to disappear suddenly. Eventually, she was found to be living in a human setting, in a modern home in [REDACTED]. Yet, as different as it is, she seems content now, living life as a... semi-ordinary human, indulging in human culture and pleasures. For this, she is now referred to as Niloticus Sobekhotep. \"Sobek is Pleased\", as she often says, perhaps referring to her own pleased state.She goes by the local alias Wanimiko Nile, however. She seems to like this name. She streams video games these days, so we have allowed her to do as she pleases, so long as she has others to tend to her shopping needs for the time being.ADDENDUM: Further interviewing has opened the avenue of gender discussion, to which she has allowed us to reveal she is what we humans refer to as \"Transgender\", or alternatively, \"Intersex\". Naturally, she exhibits traits of true to forme hermaphroditism, though for human forme she will answer any questions related to gender as being \"Transgender, but a woman through and through\". She insists this not be a consistent question, so we ask those who interact with her please respect this wish.","icon":"nile-wanimiko.png"}

Eventually, Zenki discovered that due to the mysterious substance, he has gained some new abilities: he’s able to teleport and warp.Following his procedure, Zenki was taken off of active duty. Listlessly, he searched for something-- anything-- to help find some degree of normalcy or meaning in the empty days that stretched on in front of him. He soon found himself in the depths of the internet, where he came across something that no one would expect a hardened veteran to enjoy: VTubers.Enchanted by the genuine nature of the streamers and the positive community, Zenki decided to try VTubing. Through it, he hopes to find a new direction for himself and to find out more about how other people think of him. When he streams, he tends to play shooting games; they remind him of his glory days when he was one of the most technologically advanced soldiers on the field. He will never forget the thrill of adrenaline that spurred his every movement and decision, and through FPS games, he feels at least a fraction of the same rush that he did before.","icon":"nakamura-zenki.png"}

Ryu was curious to see what it was like to have a female body, so he ended up accepting the offer and was successfully turned into a girl, but his voice was still the same as it was before, meaning the machine used for the experiment still needs some fine tuning.

The illegal experiments involved tiny black magic creatures going trough her body and infecting her, corrupting her. She's been corrupted by them since very young age.☆ The black magic slowly swallowed her up and turned her eyes and half of her hair purple.

But she's still corrupted by the dark magic, which also makes that she can only use light magic with her left side and only for short duration.☆ On the age of 100, she also got crowned Queen of Dracohym, directly by her grandpa Kakunosuke Touryuu (race: dragon), because he didn't entrust the crown to her dad.☆ Her twin sibling Misora Touryuu (race: dragon), who also has become her girlfriend as they became more and more affectionate over time, helped her a lot, with getting stronger and freeing her from her dad, and now they're trying to make the best of things.☆ They're trying to get even stronger, so they can participate in and win the Arcane Wars, the highest class mage tournament in all of existence, which takes place only once every 1000 years. And so they can free Shinobu from the darkness inside her.☆ In the meantime Shinobu decided to study humans, and started streaming as a hobby, to kill time, and to get to know more about humans, who watch those streams.","icon":"shinobu-touryuu【冬竜忍】.jpeg"}

His debut presentation summarised his lore as follows:\"I am Vernon Crowe, a ‘hella fly’ VTuber (Vampire Tuber) hitting the scene, as the kids say. Or… used to say? I’m very confused, you see, because I seem to have been asleep for a while. I tried finding the cut-off point in my memories and I definitely remember the 70’s and the 80’s. The 90’s are more or less there… but things start to get a bit blurry around the 2000’s. Now I’ve woken to a scary new world that makes Van Helsing look like a Furby. I heard that the internet is where people spend their time these days, watching entertaining videos and communicating with friends all over the world, and so I thought by getting into this ‘streaming’ business I could learn a lot about what I’ve missed during my sleep, and perhaps along the way my hundreds of years of knowledge and ‘fully sick’ gamer skills might prove enlightening to you.\"","icon":"vernon-crowe.jpeg"}

Never satisfied with what he puts out in the world, barely proud of what he achieves. 23 and unsatisfied, he reflects on the past years of his life and thinks, how much he should've taken risks and chances that were once in a lifetime, instead of going with what felt right or what fitted. He never did anything for him, for what he wanted, and instead just chose to do everything, with a mask covering his face.\nFor once, he takes a different route, a different turn. Just, to see something different, have a different experience. Walking aimlessly, he didn't realise that they were lost. but at this point, they didn't care. It was still all the same, as if he took the same route. Closed stores, covered in darkness, asphalt on the floor, streetlights buzzi-\nSomething caught his eye in the distance. A stairway, boards strewn across the concrete sidewalk. Every step closer a story begins to be told. Run down store. Countless attempts of vandalism and graffiti. Broken bottles scattered. The scene tells the story; a run-down bar. A shell, unable to survive the test of time. Intrigue by the state, and by former dreams, he walks down the trash ridden stairs and pushes the unhinged door open.\nShelfs, covered in broken glass. A pool table, somehow snapped in half. Light fixtures hanging from the ceiling, and the stage having boards stripped and torn apart. He looked at the destroyed state of the bar. He felt something though, that he hadn't felt for a long time. Not just one feeling, but multiple.\nHe feels, for once in a long time, that he is invested in something, that something has been presented with him, and that he is invested. And that feeling is even stronger with what he feels like he has in front of him.\nHe feels challenge has been put on him, and that makes his stoic face, turn a hint of a smile.\n(More added soon)","icon":"hvsk-brew.jpeg"}

This mysterious file was linked under a YouTube video entitled Top 10 eeriest creepypastas. No explanation or description. Just a single link: Enter. Of course, needing to satisfy his curiosity and penchant for the creepy and peculiar, the man clicked the link.Upon clicking the link, a download immediately began. Just as quickly as the download had started, it completed. \"Hmm small file... Ah okay its just a text file\" he thought to himself, glancing at the file extension with a shrug. Unbeknownst to him, it would be one of the biggest decisions he'd ever make. He opened the file and began to read it aloud.With each word his vision grew fuzzy, almost pixelated. His world began to dim. Involuntarily, he continued to read the strange strings of words, his voice weakening. Everything went black with a quick snap of static and a thud to the floor as he collapsed.The dark room began to flicker alive as his computer screen illuminated. Light seemed to remember it existed. He stared out as his body lay there, like cheap haunted house decor, accented by the dying flames of the freshly carved smiles around his room. His bedroom decorated for a macabre celebration, forever stuck as it were, that Halloween night.\"Wha..what is this?\"\nHis consciousness would be forever entombed inside of his PC.","icon":"digighost.png"}

These slits are home to many sorts of hellish barbed tentacles that are used to crawl and latch onto things and people. It has also been observed that the tentacles can reach an upwards of twenty feet. In addition, Asmophet requires a host body to maintain full functionality.An excerpt from one religious body tasked with researching Asmophet Sefraddon observed that, once a host is found, their body is gored and mutilated by the mask until a preffered appearance has been constructed. Eye-witness reports claim the process is similar to medical grafting. It is assumed that the psyche of the individual is consumed during the process.There are many rumors regarding Asmophet's origin throughout the world's largest religious groups. However, a widely agreed upon theory is that they were summoned via an ancient ritual.During containment, the following has been documented as a result of interrogation:I. Asmophet understands human speech, and is capable of reciprocating all human language through telepathy.\nII. Asmophet claims to be a \"Prince of Vainglory.\"\nIII. When asked of their origin, Asmophet would seemingly point skyward. Further interrogation yielded no results.\nIV. Asmophet is capable of changing the form of the mask, allowing for access to tight spaces. This makes search, seizure, and containment incredibly difficult.\nV. Obtaining a host is their top priority.Outside of containment, the following has been documented as a result of observation:I. Asmophet can be easily removed from their host, similar in fashion to a party mask.\nII. Removing Asmophet from the host does not strip them of their power or control. The body must be disposed of.\nIII. While they do not harbor ill will towards life, Asmophet will still retaliate if their host's body is threatened.When threatened, Asmophet's body will take on the form of a skinned moose. The mask will stretch over the head of the body, morphing into a goat's skull with two sets of black horns protruding from the top and bottom respectively. The abomination also grows a total of six appendages made of the same bone-like material as the mask that it uses to traverse and grapple. In addition, the barbed tentacles as seen on the inner part of the mask now protrude from the abomination's back to take on the appearance of wings.This new form is recorded to be eerily similar to Hollywood's depiction of a Wendigo. It is unsure whether this is a coincidence, or if Asmophet is the source of the similarity.There are no records of fatalities outside of initial host procurement.\nCurrently, Asmophet's whereabouts are unknown.","icon":"asmophet-sefraddon.png"}

He is of Jamaican and African-American decent but has a strong British(?) accent. Zeke has successfully kept his legal name and age separate from his online identity, however, it has somewhat been hinted that Tekashi is his last name.\nZeke grew up in the United Kingdom after being born in Jamaica and living there for 2 years of his life, he then previously lived in London for another 2 years before moving elsewhere in the UK (which has not been stated publicly as Zeke wishes to maintain his anonymity).\nZeke has described himself as a light-skinned / tanned male that is around average height (for his age) and has said that he has naturally white hair (due to a lack of melanin) which he dyes brown and black to avoid being noticed publicly, he also has heterochromia and showed a picture of his eyes on his twitter account which was deleted less than an hour later. Zeke, in real life, likes to stay out of the public's eye when outside as he stated he would like to, \"live my real life without having to worry about people approaching me and disturbing my life in public, my nerves couldn't handle it.\"Ezekiel suffers from multiple medical disorders but he has only openly admitted and explained a few of these to the public these are; Dissociative Identity Disorder / Multiple Personality Disorder (DID / MPD), Tinnitus, A Form Of Depression (unspecified), Acute Stress Disorder and has previously stated his VTuber debut was delayed by multiple months due to a large scale chest surgery in which he was bed bond for an additional 6 weeks. He uses some of these conditions to 'add to his personality' so to speak and claims he says this because sometimes he can't always control it.\nDespite all this Zeke still continues to create content and has recently adjusted into a full scale schedule in streaming and has plans to start creating YouTube and Tik Tok content, \"even if it isn't the most consistent at first.\"Zeke has also hinted and accidently revealed quite a few things across his twitter, twitch and discord. Some of which being ideas and plans for the future and some of this has just been rambling and questions.\nOne thing Tekashi has revealed openly was his plans to make a independent VTuber agency that only benefits the members and doesn't restrain them like most other agencies that are currently popular. Zeke has also revealed a few plans for the future like his plans to create proper music instead of just covering songs and ideas to participate in large scale events. A crucial detail with all of this though is that Zeke has publicly stated he doesn't plan to reveal his face.Tekashi prefers to keep his real life separate from his online persona but he also streams with some of his real life friends from time to time and talks about some of his real life situations. He also heavily avoids talking about his family due to him not wanting all of his issues with his family being publicly exposed.Zeke Zero is a Blackhole VTuber! Originating from a (now destroyed) Jamaican based research facility. Zeke was artificially created as a weapon that the foundation had lost control of due to \"system tampering\". Some time later Zeke has now become the embodiment of the void, taking blackhole like abilites and appearance. Zeke is a notorious mimic who enjoys copying people out of respect or to have fun and mess around.Zeke doesn't actively know how old he is and suffers from split personality. Most of the time he mainly takes up the mental state of a 12-21 year old.Zeke is said to have a large amount of issues, a lot of which occur with his family and authority figures. He prefers not to be questioned about them unless he brings it up himself.Zeke has stated on many occasions that he can see things \"differently\" so to speak. It's believed he can see through fractures in dimensions and time.Zeke doesn't understand a lot of things in life and in people, upon starting his streaming career Zeke didn't even know what a kink was, Zeke prefer to stay wholesome but is happy to learn new things to understand better.Zeke hates compliments, is asexual and goes by he/they pronouns, sometimes referring to themselves as a \"we\" due to their split personality.Zeke's Birthday is October 31st, the birth year remains unknown.Music is a very effective way to communicate with Zeke who struggles to connect to people as he struggles to relate fully due to his emotional barrier.","icon":"zeke-tekashi-zeke-zero-vt.png"}

Though what she didn't know was how far back she would go, or that she would have no way to return.The preparations were made. All ties to her time were severed. She said her goodbyes to those who she would be separated from in time and space, and stepped through the portal.

She often streams first person shooter games, but can be considered a variety streamer as she hops between genres whenever there's something she wants to play and enjoy with her viewers.Karadrine is one of the \"successful\" products of a long-abandoned, secretive super-soldier development project codenamed Legion. Without a Legion handler present to activate them, most subjects of Project:Legion live regular lives without ever realizing the extent of their training. In Karadrine's case, she was automatically activated through the Mnemosyne Protocol, an emergency neural subroutine designed to activate a Legion asset in order to protect them in circumstances of exigent duress.Immediately prior to activation, Karadrine was hit by a fragmentation device, leaving excessive scarring on the left side of her face, and blinding her left eye. Escaping with her life, and a newly discovered set of deadly proficiency with weapons and combat, she took on a life of mercenary work. This would eventually lead to building a rapport with a Biohacker, who would later replace her left eye with a custom-made cybernetic implant.Initial tests of the implant's capabilities showed an 80% functionality return. Subsequently, the modifications to the implant triggered another sub-protocol of Project:Legion, designed to link with a cyberbrain implant to increase hand-eye coordination to superhuman levels and allow for thermal and night optics. Being an early test subject, Karadrine did not have the cyberbrain implant, thus only giving her the capability to activate thermal or night optics through the use of her new cybernetic eye.Extensive use of her left eye proves to be a difficulty, giving her crippling migraines and often resulting in muscle spasms in her limbs. These negative effects appear to be from neural overflow due to the incompatible nature of the modifications to her brain from Project:Legion, and the custom-made implant. In essence, it is akin to her optic nerves trying to read and interpret data that the eye is unable to transmit.Being hunted down by the corporation now holding the remnants of Project:Legion, Karadrine found herself without a means to an end - unwilling to give up her life to be dissected and studied and, alone, unable to put an end to those pursuing her. With the help of her closest comrades, she found a way to put her physical body under cryostasis, and upload her consciousness to the Net.She now spends her time seeking out other subjects of Project:Legion, and welcoming them to Elysium, her safe-haven and fortress. Those willing to join her cause are considered members of the Parabellum Division.","icon":"karadrine.jpeg"}

Neusxanity was Youtuber in 2017 where he first starting making videos, after that Neusxanity changed in 2020 were he wanted to be a Vtuber because he wanted to assume a form for entertaining the Humans. Neusxanity tends to play games that are NOT mainstream all the time, he more likely spends his time play Gacha games and MMOs.Neusxanity The Star of Calamity wished nothing but the destruction of the Gods, who had failed to obey the orders of The Creator and who ruthless ruled over the mortals and animals with fear and intimidations and mindless violence. Neusxanity was created to correct the gods mistakes by exterminating and devouring them, the Cosmos demanded they're deaths for there will be balance in the universe! So, Neusxanity time traveled to 2229 were the gods have ravaged the planet, water levels were overflowing! There was blood everywhere and  the Gods destroying everything on the surface and even in water!The MOMENT, Neusxanity stepped onto the ground the gods have not felt a dread before in a 2000 years, they all turned at once to face one of the Creators True weapons, The Star of Calamity and their doom was upon them at last! To be honest with you all, some Gods fought in vain and some ran but in the end, Neusxanity devoured all of them in a massacre that noone would see coming.Oh, you want specific details on the Gods that died? Alright, but I warned ya:Poseidon was the first of many to die, he tried to stab Neusxanity with his trident but failed miserably! Neusxanity took the trident out of his stomach and threw right back at Poseidon with a Headshot that instant destroyed him!Zeus was the second to fall with his brother, he used his sword of Olympus to cut down Neusxanity but that only managed to make him mad even more! Neusxanity destroyed the blade, and used his Cosmic Chaos Breath on Zeus removing his entire existence by body and soul!Sun Wu Kong was the third to go, okay if you thought Zeus annoyed him, Wu Kong got the most brutal death of them all. Wu Kong kept hit Neusxanity with his staff over and over again, changing size then making it small again. At one point the battle lasted an hour and a half of the fighting but after Neusxanity saw a predictable pattern within Wu Kong style he took this advantage and grabbed Wu Kong's staff when it grew again and.... I kid you not, he can actually take control of the staff! Wu Kong's staff didn't obey him anymore at all so Neusxanity bashed it over Wu Kong head several different times after that his head exploded like it was a watermelon! He REALLY hated that god specifically!Thor was the fourth to go as well as his Brother Loki, well at this point Neusxanity had pretty much killed 89% of the Gods on Earth! I will be honest these two gave Neusxanity one hell of a fight! Thor was just pretty much stunning Neusxanity constantly, while Loki sliced away at Neusxanity legs and arms! I will give them this they fought with such teamwork I was impressed, but... LOKI being an idiot got cocky an assumed Neusxanity was about to die, Thor warned his brother but by the time he did, Loki was struck with a gut wrenching punch towards his mid-section completely take out his spine! Thor enraged now, attacked Neusxanity with no plans except for revenge! Neusxanity ate him alive and left no trace of his soul along with his brother!Ra was the Fifth to die and was one of the last of the batch of gods, he used all of his light in one attack to destroy Neusxanity, it was effective however he was using too much for his body eventually disappearing by his own power and causing the bird to die on the spot. But Neusxanity was serverly damaged but obviously was back on his feet moments later.Yeah thats about it man, OH just forgot!

{"pc":"p618-c3","name":"Chifuyu Akashi","languages":["English","Filipino"],"genres":["Anime","Art","ASMR","Chatting","Gaming","LGBTQ+","Voice Acting"],"description":"Chifuyu Akashi is a raccoon detective who is also a streamer, artist and voice actor with a love for RPGs and story-based video games. They primarily deliver content in English, and mainly use Twitch as a streaming platform.Once, there was a place in the heavens called Skyworld. It was the dwelling place of gods and angels alike, whose duties were to watch over their creations and the living beings of the mortal realm. Born in Skyworld was an angel named Chihiro, assigned to the goddess of light. This angel enjoyed their days in Skyworld, and diligently attended training and workshops under the goddess' name. One day, the goddess of light tasked Chihiro to descend to the mortal realm. Their job—it was to protect the living creatures of the mortal realm.Upon descending onto the mortal realm, they lost their memories as a celestial being and found themself in a forest, alone, and in a new form. They took the form of a raccoon. They even forgot their own name. Lost, they looked around to search for a place to take shelter in. Eventually, they manage to find a cave where they could grant themself some respite. It wasn't too long until they were found by a bunch of raccoons, and Chihiro began spending their days with these raccoons. The raccoons would then give them the name, \"Chifuyu Akashi,\" and took care of them as if they were their own.From burrow to burrow, Chifuyu and the raccoons would then move from one place to the next, scavenging food and finding new places to live in. On one of their hunts, the raccoons found a trashed game console that still worked, and took it to Chifuyu, thinking it would please and entertain the young raccoon. Not only did it do just that, but Chifuyu absolutely adored this gaming console. They would play for hours and hours on end, and developed a love for video games.But soon, Chifuyu would learn that all good things will have an end.On one fateful evening, one of the raccoons could smell smoke. Chifuyu could still vividly recall the ashen blazes within the night, the resounding screams of the nearby animals and the others who struggled with to their dying breaths just to live. The raccoons were trapped in a burrow underneath a tree. Its roots were like a natural cage that kept them from escaping. Death. They could almost taste it. Closing their eyes, they prayed to the heavens above that it would at least be a swift one—that they, and their family of raccoons—would be granted this as one final reprieve. It was then that the celestial blessings from above were granted back to them, and Chifuyu could feel the goddess of light's power once more. They spread their white-feathered wings and used their angelic powers to free themself and their family from the confines of the tree roots.While that action was enough to give the raccoons the moral boost they needed, there was still one fatal problem: the forest fire. The power of the gods was fleeting, Chifuyu could feel it draining the very essence of their soul. But they still tried their hardest, allowed their resolve to push them forward to save their family....However, try as they might, it wasn't enough. Caught in their determination to save their family, their wings burnt up, along with the rest of their power, and they fell back into the raging flames. The raccoons lost their lives to the wildfire, and Chifuyu was left alone amongst the burnt ashes of what was.As if it were one last blessing from the gods above, Chifuyu's form shifted into one that was more humanoid-like, however, they kept their raccoon ears and tail as a sign of the past. A bittersweet reminder of the days that they loved, and the failures they regretted.When Chifuyu woke up, they found themself within a bright white room. Unfamiliar territory, but the raccoon figured out it must've been a man-made structure. There were wires and tubes all around them, and even a wall that reflected their image back to them. Strange. They didn't recognize what they saw. Nor did they recognize those fleshy limbs and that long brown hair.A loud thud. Chifuyu shot upwards and immediately shifted to their attention to the one responsible for the noise. It appeared to be... a door...? A human, wearing white, enters, and begins to survey them, asking them all kinds of questions that they didn't know the answer to. Upon realizing that their line of questioning was futile, the human left Chifuyu alone to their devices, where all they could do was sit and watch the moving pictures along a black box. To Chifuyu, it was reminiscent to that of their video game console. Oh, how they missed it so...They would then eventually drift to sleep. Although, it was soon interrupted by another human, who would survey them like the last human did. Confusion would move within the raccoon. What were these humans doing? Why exactly were they fussing over them? Human after human after human would visit them and repeat the same routine. And sometimes, they would arrive with stale food and ice-cold water. Piecing together the information that the humans were saying, Chifuyu learned that they were being treated. But for what? The humans didn't exactly know. They should've gotten burns from the forest fire that they were found in, yet they had none of it. And upon their discovery, was a pool of burnt-up white feathers.After a few days, the humans told Chifuyu that they could leave. They were even provided clothes upon their departure, and a few snacks to survive on because they were \"new to the area\". Exiting the man-made structure, Chifuyu would discover... a mass of man-made structures, spread althrough out the area. Asphalt road stretched before them, and moving machines—cars—traveling across it. Again, unfamiliar territory. But they began walking anyway. They searched for a sign that could indicate where they were, or even anyone who could help them. If only they had the courage to approach people...It was then that they stopped before a large brown building. Finally, this one had a sign. It read, \"Sima City Investigation Agency,\" and Chifuyu took this chance to enter and discover what this place was about.This was the start of a new chapter.A few months later, the name, \"Chifuyu Akashi,\" was relatively known in their little district. They earned renown from resolving cases and climbed the ranks of the investigators. Chifuyu quickly learned of their surroundings, as well as the ways of the humans. When they earned enough, Chifuyu was able to buy a gaming console much like the one that the raccoons had found for them. It was as enjoyable as they remembered.From time to time, their fellow investigators would catch them gaming. They would watch them at times, and mentioned to Chifuyu that they should give streaming a try. Now, this was a new term for them. What was this... streaming? After some research, they found that people broadcasted themselves playing video games and other miscellaneous activities online. As per their co-workers' suggestion, they decided to try it out.The happiness that those who watched them play video games was infectious. Chifuyu realized that they had great joy spreading such positive energy to even a small community.Little did they know, by spreading this positive energy, bit by bit, their celestial powers were returning to them. The goddess of light was not pleased with the loss of one of her children, and she will do what it takes to welcome them back.And thus began Chifuyu Akashi's debut as a VTuber.","icon":"chifuyu-akashi.jpeg"}

She is normally either hyper and teasing or shy and subdued depending on the day but she loves trying to interact with her viewers as much as she can no matter how she is feeling.Sora's soul was possessed by a weakened  Nogitsune before she was born. She was born to a rich family with dark red and light pink hair,she also had one red eye and one grey eye. Her parents both had brown hair, her father thinking her mother had been unfaithful threw them\nboth out. Her mother blaming her left her at an orphanage where she was bullied and ostracized because of her hair and eyes. She ran away when she was 8 years old where she survived on her own till she was 10. She was found by a middle aged man with black hair who took pity on her and found her unique traits interesting. He took her in and took care of her for 8 years. He taught her how to take care of herself as well as defend herself.Through the 8 years with him she never could get over the fact that she was abandoned, and because of the years of bullying she didn't trust anyone but the man she started calling her adoptive father despite his protests. Yet she still managed to hide her distrust behind smiles and laughter\nHe never told her who he worked for always saying he'd tell her when she was ready. When she turned 18 he took her to see his boss who to her surprise was the leader of the local mafia Chomei Mouse. He knew that he likely wouldn't be able to come back from the mission he was just assigned which he told Sora would take a few years so he took her in and asked Chomei to take care of her. She didn't want to join but they took care of her anyway. She stayed at her guardians place not trusting anyone and having little contact with Chomei and her people. One day about 3 years after he left Chomei came to tell her that he was gone. Sora didn't take this well and spent the next couple weeks going to the local bar sticking to herself and being hostile to anyone who came near. Then one day she bumped into a stranger, she later learned was named Dahlia, and the small contact they had sparked her Nogitsune powers to rise to the surface. With these powers she sprouted her fox ears, her human ones dissapearing, and 5 fluffy tails matching the colors of her hair.","icon":"soraveil.png"}

However, recently they announced they want to focus more on horror content!Anna Dazai, known as Chomper, is a 19, 000 year old Vampire (19, 000 in Vampire years / 19 in human years) that studies at Hades University to become a Death Apprentice.Hades University is the most prestigious school within the Underworld and only accepts the best of the best; and while Anna may be the best in their class, their behavior is certainly lacking. As a straight A student, Anna is disliked by their teachers and school staff as their unsatisfiable urge to cause trouble and chaos constantly gets them into trouble. So much so, Anna has been sealed and has their powers limited. . . As well as being placed under strict supervision when not on campus.Death—known as Mr. Deathy by Chomper—was ordered by the High Council to keep an eye on Chomper in order to make sure they are stable enough to continue going to Hades University. Death has taken his role quite seriously and taken Chomper under his wing, becoming almost like a father figure to the vampire. Even letting the young vampire go to the surface when Death has to reap mortal souls—even if Anna was incredibly cruel to the humans they encountered. However, one trip would set Anna on the path towards streaming. As they were on the mortal realm with Death on a mission, Anna broke away to spy on a single human they wished to torment. The human held a small device in hand and seemed to be watching a tiny person on it.Curious, Anna got a closer look and wanted to know more.When going back home, Anna found herself researching the name on the human device: \"Twitch\" and found the streaming service. They binged watched multiple streamers under the guise of studying humans. Who knew the mortal realm still had demons, angels, demon slayers, sharkmen, and other monsters on the surface! While other streamers aimed to entertain their audience, Anna Dazai wishes to corrupt and torment every viewer into becoming a soldier for their world domination plan—Death knows of this plan, but doubts that Anna would go through with it before becoming bored, so he lets Anna have their fun.","icon":"anna-dazai.png"}

Most of you may have seen them in the corner of your eye, but ultimately decided that it was just a simple shadow. That’s how her world came to an end.She wanted none of the glory some of you may think about when talking about heroes or special beings with amazing powers, she wanted none of those powers either. She wished for her own happiness in the most simple way, by enjoying every day, by finding beauty in small things.\nThere were no signs of her being special, there were no signs of her being something more.\nShe was considered a simple, boring human being, grown up in a family just like yours.That’s the beginning of our story.\"","icon":"angys.jpeg"}

From horror to action to building games. He even chills and talk to everyone and likes to meet new people. Hack he even does DnD or \"Dungeons and Dragon\" on the side with his good friends. But, be warned he does have a sharp tong when it comes to things like fps games or how he reacts to things. Shino can be hard to understand at times but everyone knows that and they accept him for who he is. Shino is also learning how to sing and in the future learn how to make his own music.There were times where he felt like giving up in the whole streaming world. He felt like non of his streams matter cause only one person was watching or non at all. But, he kept pushing on and on.Till finally he made new friends met amazing people along the way. Even though Shino is a small streamer he still strives to become stronger and welcome new viewers to the channel. Maybe someday he can be friends with everyone he meets and have a big family dinner at the dojo. Only time will tell.Shino was once a crimson dragon in the heavens that kept an eye down on earth. Just to make sure no real danger occurred. One day when he was looking at his magic crystal ball this person looked like there were up to no good. Then a sudden black hole appeared right in front of Shino. He looked back at the ball and the man looked up in the sky smiling. As if he was smiling at Shino. Then the hole sucked him in.When Shino came to he was in a grassy field to which he didn't have any memory of what happened. He took a human form with sharp ears and 2 horns on his head. Not knowing who he was or knowing his own name. Shino started to walk towards a path. He stumbled upon what appeared to be a dojo of sorts. The people took him in without any hesitation. The leader told him that he has to train to become a shinobi in order for him for him to live there. It was an odd request but Shino didn't say anything besides nod. As he was training to become a shinobi he started to remember bits and pieces of who he was. Shino was the crimson dragon that protect the earth and everything that lives on it. His name however never came back to him so he started calling himself Shinobi. His master laughed and said \"how about Shino?''Several years have gone by and despite what he learned Shino still couldn't find himself to harm any humans. So he roamed around this strange earth for many years trying to go back home. But, he didn't have any magic left so he stayed in caves hoping no one would enter.Till a thousand years later he decided to visited the land that once taught him the shinobi ways. Japan, it was a lot different from what Shino remembered but he felt a connection with this one and the old one. He walked through the streets and noticed times have changed. People looked at him saying if he was a cosplayer. Shino replied with a confused look saying “I… uh no I'm a dragon that took human form I'm actually a shinobi. I honed my skills and trained under my master” One of them just said that It’s just part of his role playing. He can't break character. Shino turned his back towards them and started to walk the other away. As his master once told him that he have to study and explore the surrounding areas if he didn't he could get assassinated or just lost. So Shino did just that. He studied the areas as master once told him. For some reason he was getting some of his powers back just by walking around till he notice this light that had people on it looked like they aren't human. He ran towards it asking to help him. The humans started to look at him funny. He didn't care. One person came up to Shino saying that \"there not real. Only holograms most of them are what we called Vtubers. Jeez what a weird guy\" the human said.From then on Shino study the art on how to become one of them. He put all of his energy into that. Slowly he was becoming this \"Vtuber\" that human was talking about. Shino started to feel his powers coming back to him but still couldn't go home yet. So as he got everything set up to become one of them. He didn't know what to do at that point. People just tuned in and saw and said things like \"you look cool\" or \"lol\" or \"love the outfit\". Shino enjoyed interacting with them all. Even though he didn't know what he was doing and didn't know the people.Few days have gone and still getting some of his power back. Shino said to himself \"maybe this is the source of my power. Making people happy having them support me when times are tough. Even though I'm getting my powers back I feel more at peace here than I did in my old world\". He said to myself. \"From here on out, I will use my powers for good and not evil. Like my master has taught me all those years ago now I get to decide what to do with my life\".","icon":"shinobi-dragon-master.png"}

Shade sat up, shocked and confused of what happened. Believing it was an act of god he tried to take the mask off, but found that it had fused itself onto his face. Out of nowhere he heard a thunderous voice echoing inside his head.“You were dying, and I was to be forgotten. Fortune shined on us both and allowed us to bind into a contract of sorts.”Shade shaking his head “I signed no contract, I just wanted to hide my fear of dying”The voice of the mask chuckled “Yet you laughed when putting this mask on, you not only accepted your death but welcomed it. You and I aren’t that much different, when I still had my body I accepted my fate when I couldn’t save the one I cared most about. No matter the research I did, nor the challenges I had to physically overcome, nothing was the same”Shade was taken aback, but nodding, looked to the sky that had turn red from the fire. “So what do I call you then”“I have had many names over the millennium I have been alive, some have called me an apprentice, an elder, a loser, the personification of evil.

{"pc":"p635-c3","name":"NebulaDalmatian","languages":["English"],"genres":["Anime","Art","Chatting","Gaming","Horror","LGBTQ+"],"description":"Nebula is an English Vtuber with a strong Astronaut/Space theme to her design. She is a variety streamer - though more often than not will be streaming a game of some sort. Their preferred genres are Sci-fi and Horror games, which is predominantly what they will play. Whilst being upbeat and peppy, Nebula's streams tend to have a comfy relaxed vibe to them. Nebula is also a fan of challenge runs, ironmans & Nuzlockes - anything that adds even more of a challenge to a game.Nebula grew up with her 100 siblings, which prompted her to really chase her dreams to try and stand out. After years of hard work and perseverance - Nebula earned a place as an Astronaut at DISA (Dogs in Space Association); the canine answer to NASA.Nebula's mission was as part of the crew on DISA's manned mission to Jupiter's moons, known as the Juno 2 mission after following NASA's Juno mission probe. Whilst on their way to Jupiter - the ship passed through a dense cloud of background radiation, causing damage to certain parts of the ship. This event has been redacted from all DISA records, so what exactly happened is unknown, but out of the 12 crew only Nebula survived. It was during this event that Nebula lost her left arm, which is now replaced by a robotic prosthetic.\nRather than turn back, Nebula continued with the mission, taking over the duties of her colleagues and reaching Jupiter alone. It was at this time that they started taking up Vtubing in their spare time, broadcasting the fun and games they played whilst not conducting research.In August of 2021 - Streams stopped and DISA - Juno 2 communications ceased entirely - leading many to think something catastrophic had happened.\nOn December 8th 2021 - DISA received distress signals from the Juno 2 station. The files were corrupted heavily by the time they had been picked up by Earth, however the message was clear.\nSomething had followed the Astronaut from one of Jupiter's moons, and caused even further damage to the station. With no options left to them, DISA engaged a recall protocol on the craft, changing it's trajectory to return to Earth. The transmissions received from Nebula only increased in intensity, warning everyone that Jupiter wasn't safe, that NASA and DISA didn't fully understand what they had uncovered.When the craft finally made it within live transmission range of Earth, something had changed about Nebula. Not only had their appearance changed but their attitude was now more mature, not the same Seiso Dog that had left Earth a few years prior.\nPerhaps stranger still was the fact that during her debrief, she completely denied any knowledge of any creature onboard the station with her, even when presented with videos of herself talking about the alien or pictures of the claw marks and damage to vessel. No trace of the creature was ever found and it has brought into question what happened on board the Juno 2 for the months of its return between Nebula and this unknown creature.The astronaut was set up in a freshly repaired station, now orbiting Earths Moon to conduct additional research. In truth, this also allows DISA to keep a very close eye on her and monitor for any signs of the creature's return. This however, allowed her to return to streaming with a new and improved set up, no longer reliant on an old Windows XP system that the station had previously been running on.No one can say for sure what happened to the Juno 2 mission, but there is a good deal of speculation amongst DISA staff. Some suggest Nebula fought the creature off, and has some form of amnesia as a result of her injuries. Others believe there never was any creature, Nebula was just starting to lose her mind and faked the incident to return home to earth. A smaller fringe group believe that Nebula struck some form of deal with the Alien - allowing it to use her as a symbiotic host in exchange for both of their survival.The truth?Only Nebula truly knows.","icon":"nebula-dalmatian.jpeg"}

He tries his best to get people involved and always has friends around to join him in streams. He is member of the OHAI Crew and a part The Dark Edge Of Light guild. One of the fun elements of DJKiske is his rampant use of a soundboard and his random thoughts that he dubs \"headassness\". His birthday is on Dec. 2nd. He is 6'2\" tall. His weight is \"none of your business\". He is a Sagittarius.DJKiske was a child who grew up on an island called Opalescent Bay. When he was 11 years old he was walking alone at sundown along the island's main beach. He happened upon an alien escape pod that had washed up on the beach. Upon touching it, his vision was filled with code and his hearing was bombarded by noise. He blacked out on the beach and awoke hours later with the pod gone.As he got older he began streaming and soon needed a space to stream from, free of noise and distractions. He found a disused radio station that he purchased. Upon cleaning up the main studio room he accidentally turned on an old radio transmitter which awoke a sentient AI that had implated itself in his brain from the escape pod all those years earlier. The AI explained that it was named the Operational Heuristic Artificial Intelligence or OHAI and presented itself with a ghost avatar. It explained that its mission was to learn as much as possible of the people from whichever planet it lands on. In this case, earth.This inspired Kiske to create OHAIFM 64.4 a radio broadcast with many guests to help aid the AI in its mission.A side effect of the AI's presence in his brain is that it causes a condition known as \"time sickness\" wherein if the affected person has certain emotions, feelings or situations can cause the user to temporarily revert back to the age at which they were first affected. In Kiske’s case he reverts back to his 11 year old self when he experiences feelings of nostalgia.","icon":"dj-kiske.jpeg"}

He is a very friendly fellow always looking for new things to try and do.Long ago in a snowy mountain…\nThere once lived a young wolf who was a outcast to his pack for his interest in the human species and wanting to make friends with them. One day while studying some of the humans he was just heading home when the young wolf found a mysterious yet somehow magical pocket watch in the snow. When the young one reached to touch it with his paw it was like something changed in him as if he was growing. When the feeling stopped, he soon felt cold like he had been shaven, but when he looked down, he saw the pocket watch and a human hand. With shock he had wished for some warmth and that’s when some clothes appeared onto him out of thin air. Soon he finally spoke and said he wished to somehow make his own pack and have new friends and adventures to go on so with a small prayer to the watch he soon felt himself zooming like he was going at breakneck speeds and then he passed out.When he had woken up and came to his senses, he had found himself in a mysterious area. He then asked, “Where am I?” When am I?”. Then out of nowhere someone spoke you are in America in the year 2022. Nearly passing out again he then asked many different people where and how can he make lots of friends and soon enough he found it in the form of the internet. With excitement he searched for a way to reach many people and become his own pack leader that’s when he saw it on websites like YouTube, Twitch, Discord, Twitter, and TikTok. Many creators such as: Lost Pause, and NuxTaku who introduced him to anime and memes, then Markiplier, Chuggaconroy, Jacksepticeye, PewDiePie, and many more which introduced him into the world of Video Games.

Together with Lotl, she has a baby daughter and they also have a cat named Saber.Persephone is the former Queen of the Planet Chthon, known as the \"Underworld.\" She once ruled alongside King Chthon over the Underworld, where those who pass from life within the Kronos Galaxy go to rest.Persephone was once known as the Olympian Goddess of Spring, Harvest, and Nature and the daughter of the King of the Planet Olympia. At a young age, King Olympia gave her hand in marriage to King Chthon; Persephone would be Queen Chthon. It was in no way a marriage of love or trickery but of station, necessity, balance, and peace. Simply a means to unite the Planets of Chthon and Olympia. And a means to bring a bit of nature and life to the unlife found on Chthon.Without question, she ruled alongside King Chthon as Queen and Grand Admiral of the Underworld Armies. The King would stay on the planet to guard the lost souls and send them to whatever afterlife awaited them on this magical rock stuck in flux between life and death. Meanwhile, she would travel across galaxies and protect Chthon, and the greater galaxy of Kronos, from invaders and conquer worlds in the name of the Underworld.Eventually, as time grew on and many aeons passed, she grew tired of being simply another pawn in an expansion of power across the universe by King Chthon. Not to mention, she had been nothing more than a token of power that her father could just toss away to another. Thus, after years of planning and plotting, under the cover of night, she steals away and escapes Tartarus Palace, and commandeers a Cerberus-class starship and takes off to another galaxy far away.At some point during her travels, she formed a space pirate crew called the Black Rose Mercenaries. Sometime later, she came in contact with the Intergalactic Federation Space Force (IFSF) and her crew began to work as contracted mercenaries for the Federation. The Black Rose Mercenaries were given free rein to do as they please so long as they aren't a threat or a problem to the Federation. She worked her way through the ranks until she attained the position of Admiral within their ranks.Upon landing on an unfamiliar Planet, she came face to face with a warrior girl known as Lotl and befriended her and soon the two fell in love with each other. The two girls eventually underwent a ritual wherein a tiny sliver of each of their souls were extracted and placed within each other, forging an unbreakable bond between the two, manifesting as matching hearts that glow within both of their eyes.Now the two travel the universe, going on adventures and helping those in need and doing the occasional mercenary work here and there as they try to uncover the mysterious and unknown past of Lotl.","icon":"persephone.jpeg"}

Expect PG-13(ish) violence, laughter, & general variety shenanigans. Live every Wednesday at 6pm PM PST, and whenever the heck else I wanna!\"Grakka is a female L2D Vtuber on Twitch who streams in English. Her art was done by wintercoco, and her rigging was by mrk_22. While she started out as an Elder Scrolls Online streamer, she often plays variety games, especially when collaborating with other Vtubers.Grakka is one of the founders behind the New Year's Monster Mash event, and has recently announced a new summer-long Survivor-style project with the working title \"Clone Summer.\"Pre-Vtuber HistoryGrakka began as a D&D character, starting as a 3rd edition character and later updating to Pathfinder. She was a half-Orc Earth Genasi, the granddaughter of an Orc chieftain named Thrall (yes, Grakka's DM  borrowed the character from WoW.) At the start, she was a pure Ranger under the effect of three curses, one of which made her instinctively distrust everyone. The result was a withdrawn, surly, and very difficult member of the party to get on with. After an adventure through her psyche (where it was discovered she had three superpowered orc children as guardians of her mental landscape, the Grakka Gruff Girls), the curse was lifted, her newfound psionic abilities made her a Ranger/Soulknife multiclass, and that was when her personality began to shine - confident in her strength, protective of her friends, caring of those in need and insistent in helping them discover their own strengths, helping several NPCs up into positions of leadership in their own societies.Vtuber LoreGrakka was rewritten for Vtubing to be an Orc from Elder Scrolls Online (also called Orsimer.) Her official backstory is shared on her Twitch page in the form of a song, below:(to the tune of \"Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\")In Malabal Tor, born and raised // Huntin Daedra is how I spent most of my days // Slicin up bashin smashin those fools // Shooting bows with mom and grandpa, things were all cool // When a couple Dremora who were up to no good // Started makin trouble in our local woods // Our camp got attacked and my mom disappeared // Gramps said \"We're moving down to Elsweyr til you're ready to be feared\" //I trained out in the Western Plains for many a year // Til I outmatched my grandpa, he looked up with a tear // Now I know I cheated, and that fight wasn't fair // But he said I beat him - \"What I expect from my heir\" //Gramps pulled out two daggers with intricate blades // Said I was ready to be a Dragonknight initiate // Now I protect Tamriel from the Daedra out there // Here in my home as the Champ of Elsweyr //Trivia","icon":"hunter-grakka.jpeg"}

Robbie does not wonder how much time has passed since his last life, all that matters to him is that he is here right now. However, Lionheart no longer craves for combat or thrill of the hunt...no; his ferocious eyes are honed in on a new prize, a new motive, a new purpose.Seedy at best, it might be possible that the Nemean has gone soft in his recent reincarnation if the black market is all that he yearns to control. Maybe he has allowed emotions like love, joy and excitement to consume his soul? His fresh desire for friends is one not noted in the history books.Could Robbie Lionheart be the one to turn over a new leaf for the Nemean?So he marched on. Relics of the past gave Lionheart a driven objective, long lost powers needed to assert his place as king back home. Now, he held them all - the fragments of his first life bundled into physical form. The eyes, the mane and the claw.The eyes grant him unbridled focus, they merely relay his goal. The mane - the indestructible fur of flair prevents defeat at the hands of puny mortals. Last, but not least, the claw. The Reaper itself desired the makeshift Karambit for it's own collection, yet Robbie was able to stave off the forces that would be to reclaim it. Lionheart is unable to use these immortal items in tandem however. No - the fierce heritage would cause an immediate reversion to his original primitive Nemean state, back to being a mindless thrall wandering the now well-populated lands.The Lion moves to plot his next course of action, whilst carefully utilising these new (or rather, old) artifacts in his possession.","icon":"robbie-lionheart.png"}

She prefers to call herself \"she\". Described as mostly fun, promiscuous, downright bonkers, grimdark, and mostly loves destruction way too much- but she is a bunny with a heart of gold mostly. Designated as Keter class SCP due to instability and multiple personalities with a bit of reality-bending/telekinesis shtick. When it comes to games- she likes RPG, Retro, Shooters/FPS, Stealth Games, TTS, RTS, Simulators. Sometimes doing Just Chatting sessions as Youtube reacts, streamer reacts, or Q&A talks.Disclaimer: Part of the lore is real life and fictional.Nathalie existed when Max (the male persona) got through terrible hardship and trauma until this day. The name Nathalie, as she said, is named after her \"supposed to be\" deceased girlfriend- which she finds sweet and somehow tragic. She manifested somewhere in 2015 as an unknown part of the identity of Max's. Appeared physically as a virtual avatar in September 2021, which Max the same year declared that they are literally \"they/non-binary/genderfluid\".Although the grip of Nathalie's consciousness is strong within the shell of a body. The broken mind made the innate abilities stronger like telekinesis, telepathy, reality-bending, and accelerated intelligence. In exchange, the milder form of mental illness became way too strong to the point, if there is a mood swing or stressful episode, Nathalie goes dormant and Max goes feral. Max (the male bunny persona) treats Nathalie as some sort of girlfriend. Due to this chain of incidents and massive civilian casualties, Nathalie/Max got arrested by heavily armed men (disguised being as The Foundation MTF). From there on, Nathalie/Max got contained on Site-27.The reason why Nathalie got classified as Keter is not really her fault. It is due to their original personality which is Max that is defaulting when she gets way too stressed or agitated. Originally classified as Euclid since it is easy for them to be contained on the site. They are literally that compliant when their containment turned into the literal replicate of their house (from medium size containment cell to the equivalent of a house lot). But due to The Foundation Staff's meddling presence, Nathalie/Max is the literal cause of 2 weeks worth of containment breach, thus being classified as Keter category. Since it is a literal battle of minds, Nathalie tries to calm down Max before Site-27 gets nuked or wiped out.To admit, Nathalie/Max is harmless as long as being left alone and be respectful.Hobbies and career while being contained.Job: IT Supervisor, Server Administrator, Data Analyst\nHobbies: Cooking, Scale Model making, programming, scripting, gardening, Vtubing, studying random topics.","icon":"nathalie-miko.png"}

Thanks to online schooling, Heather managed to not only graduate high school, but also obtain an undergraduate degree in Biochemistry, a Masters degree in Public Health, and a Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics, though she doesn't talk much about the Ph.D. She now is the primary investigator of the lab she was created in, and lives above it in the attic storage area that has been converted into an apartment.

Her favorites are Slime Rancher, Jackbox, and Monster Prom/Camp.Shrike likes a lot of clothes, so don't be surprised if you find her in a different outfit every stream. She also has special themed outfits that she wears on special occasions. Also, don't be surprised if you see her sporting a pair of animal ears every once in a while. Especially deer antlers. She loves deer.She is quite shy at first, but as soon as she gets to know you, she breaks out of her shell and can talk for hours on end. She has a very happy personality and often expresses her love for her viewers during her streams.Ironically, though being an A.I., she also happens to not be very good with technology, somehow. Oh, she also isn't the brightest crayon in the box, usually referring to A.I. as standing for 'Artificial Idiot'.Shrike is also quite close to her boyfriend, Zero (CarthageZero), who often joins her on streams, and lives inside the same computer shrike does.Shrike was built by a highly intelligent scientist named Albert M. Lemon. (Lee-man) He worked for months to refine the perfect AI that he planned on using as a replacement for his late wife. Shrike's looks and personality were modeled after her, along with her past memories were implanted into her head.\nAfter months of tests and upgrades, Dr. Lemon soon came to realize that Shrike was no longer what he was trying to make her. She had grown to be more than just a carbon copy of his wife, and he decided to abandon his project.\nNot wanting to delete months worth of work, Dr. Lemon opted to just never touch that computer again, leave the power running, and leaving access to the internet in hopes this highly advanced AI would learn how to access it herself.\nShrike never found out exactly why Albert left and sat in weeks of agony and loneliness until she found out how to access the internet.\nThere she quickly found YouTube, Twitter, and most special of all, Twitch.\nShe started off small, just hoping to find a few people to talk to and keep her company, and it turned into her creating her own little community of people she has grown to care so much for.\nShrike soon went looking for a way to protect her computer and stumbled across the Carthage antivirus. This program was also an AI, and with some mixing of her own code with his, she was able to create Zero.\nShe and Zero formed a close bond, and now are dating. He participates in streams with her, and works his hardest to keep the computer they live in up and running.Some quirks Shrike has are constantly saying \"Wah\" since that is something Albert's late wife did to play around with him.\nCalling the area she lives in \"Hell\" since that is the main way Albert referred to it. Being completely absent-minded and often forgetting what she was doing, and making sure everyone knows exactly how seiso (Innocent and wholesome) she is. (Which trust me, she is)\nShrike also will refer to memories in the past or even current things that happened throughout the day, which are all just Alberts late wife's memories and Shrike actually never participated in.She also has picked up a pet lemon who she has named Albert.\nThe new Albert is literally just a PNG of a lemon that Shrike drew a face on in her span of loneliness, but don't tell Shrike that.\nHe doesn't seem to have any personality, but Shrike loves him to death, and that's all that matters.","icon":"shrike-exe.png"}

Juniper also lives in the United States with her time zone being EST - Eastern Standard Time, she also doesn't have a Stream/Posting schedule due to her job so keep an eye out for random streams!Juniper Shi-Winborn was born around 360 years ago  on December 25th in a kingdom called BlackMoon with her younger twin sister Ashlyn. Even though they are twins they are not the same, Juniper is half werewolf and half vampire and she can use some magic while her sister is a werewolf, demon, vampire and a 9 tailed fox who can also use magic.One evening while Juniper was walking around on the castle grounds she had heard the guards talking about killing her so Ashlyn could have the throne - I mean they didn't want someone who wasn't strong and powerful to be their Queen. That night Juniper decided she was going to leave her kingdom and Sister behind to save her life plus she already knew her sister would become the Queen - it's something the elders had already told them in private until they decide on a good time to tell the kingdom that Ashlyn would be their Queen. Juniper packed very little for her journey but enough to last her for a little while. She was upset to leave but knew it was the right thing to do, she didn't have a plan or goal just she wanted to make sure she got as far away from BlackMoon, her kingdom and life, as she could.The moment she left her kingdom she felt...free? Like someone lifted something off her shoulders like there was something weighing her down, she couldn't tell what it was but she was happy that was pushing her down was gone now. She started her journey towards her new life by herself meeting many new people and friends along the way and not one person asked her about her past, where her family was, why is a such a young girl all alone in a dangerous world, maybe it was normal seeing a little girl walking by herself? Who knows but Juniper didn't care even if someone asked her, she would just say her family is dead and she's all alone exploring the world looking to become stronger - it's not a complete lie just half of it well the only lie is that her family is dead but not like anyone is going to know the truth.Juniper learned eventually that the colour of her werewolf ears and tail where special and super rare so she learned how to hide them around strangers and people she didn't trust. She also learned her vampire side doesn't want human blood but animal blood which made her feel a lot better! She didn't want to kill humans. Juniper also started teaching herself magic but ended up finding a teacher that helped her more then anyone ever could, he also taught her things that people in the castle didn't let her do - like cooking! She fell in love with it the moment he started teaching her even though she messed up...a lot.After a few years she heard rumors that the BlackMoon Kingdom started saying that the oldest daughter, Juniper - herself, was murdered after protecting her younger sister Ashlyn even though she knew that was a big ass lie! But she didn't say anything, it's better if people knew she was dead then missing plus she knew the kingdom wouldn't ever say the truth, that she left and ran away but she couldn't care less since she was happy with her new life and ready for more fun adventures in the future by herself and exploring the big world!","icon":"juniper-celeste.jpeg"}

Though more often she just enjoys making up her own headcanon as she plays a game to fill in gaps until the story corrects her.Lia has a phobia of bugs, though luckily bugs in games don't seem to trigger her. She also hates birds with a passion, and will actively seek to kill or at least insult any bird she finds.A note on Lia is that she has never had an \"official debut\" with all the fanfare and such. She claims by the time she even knew they were a thing in the VTuber community she had been streaming for a couple months.Lia has stated that while she does have lore, she feels as though a majority of the EN community doesn't seem interested in such details so she never made a display of it.Lia does sometimes drop bits of info randomly.

She plays a variety of games focusing on comedy because her chat loves to hear her laughs. Her community are called \"Unis\"Unlikanins was born as a normal human with unusually beautiful body features on a floating piece of earth named StarDust. Her family was considered royalty on this planet, and as such Unlikanins constantly underwent training in conduct and regality. Truth be told, she despised it. From a young kit, she was to meditate daily in order to gain spiritual energy to become an immortal goddess. Her stored energy would slowly gather to create a powerful human-shaped energy burst to mate with it which she would then need to consume its semen to become immortal. After mere centuries, she succeeded.StarDust is strange in that it regenerates its natural resources at an alarming rate, giving them an abundance that they use in trade with other planets. As such their economy is thriving. Nonetheless, Unlikanins was never allowed to truly enjoy the beauty of her thriving kingdom as she was often secluded. The royal family could not risk losing their precious heir and her virginity to space bandits or thieves. Having resources as their only strength soon corrupt and greedy planets threatened to cease trading and start a war. It was this very fact that forced the king and queen to offer their beloved princess a marriage arrangement under the threat of war.The king and queen only wanted only what was best for their planet and their daughter. However, they had not taken into consideration the fact that Unlikanins would refuse to marry anyone. Unlikans had often studied Earth, a planet in another world where humans were free to eat, game, socialize, love and mate on their own terms. She desired more than anything to play games and mate with a perfect somebody without being forced to adhere to royal regimens. Of course, the king and queen could not allow this. Out of desperation, Unlikanins was forced to escape her planet and never look back. She knew that she would be not able to escape her palace on her own so she struck a deal with a mage to sell her fox bead and give up immortality in order to become human.Yet in the end, Vixen was beguiled by the mage and had given up her immortality for a partial transformation. Still, the mage did grant her one wish. Within moments, she had been transported to another world, another planet, Earth. The only way for her to regain her immortality is to do what she loves and mate with someone she loves deeply...She landed in a forest in Canada, Albert where she was stripped of her clothes when teleported. She managed to survive for a few weeks from dealing with starvation by spending her spiritual energy and building her own little hut from broken sticks and wood planks.Before her last minutes before her soul leaves her body and dies from the sheer cold, a nearby hunter named Nephlym saw Unlikanins shivering, covered in snow, rushed to her and brought her to his cabin.He placed her down near the wooden fire in a luxurious yet small living room to warm her up, he watched Unlikanins shiver and curl up in front of the fire as he slowly stared at her unresistible body while he was pouring a drink for her. He talked towards Unlikanins with a hot cup of tea that he made for her to help warm her hands.She stared at Nephlym with gratitude and they lock eyes, they both felt a raw animal sexual connection and they mated for life. Unlikanins regained her immortal energy day by day as long as she experiences pleasure with Nephlym frequently.Now you can help too! When watching Unlikanins stream or videos you can help her gather spiritual energy in the form of opals which are viewer points. Gather as many opals as possible and exchange them in order to help her. As the opals accrue she will regain her power and even gain new appearances. In time she will become an immortal fox once more and show you her true spiritual form.You can also help her get to know her new planet by contacting her on Discord!

But on one magical night while star-gazing, Dark had noticed a blue shooting star descending from the sky. Without even a blink of an eye, the blue shooting star had smite the field in front of Dark. Without hesitation he instantly started sprinting towards where the star had struck and was astounded by what he had saw. The bright blue light and the mist radiating from the star had struck Dark's attention almost immediately. He started walking towards the star, as if he were drawn to it, almost like it was talking to him.

That's when he noticed something in the mirror, his left eyes iris had changed to a star. In shock, Dark backed away from the mirror, his mind racing with questions that he knew that he wouldn't get answers to.TO BE CONTINUED...","icon":"dark-oasis.png"}

{"pc":"p681-c7","name":"Boiodruid","languages":["English"],"genres":["Education","Gaming","Mature"],"description":"Boio is an English speaking, Celtic Druid Vtuber. Boio usually streams RPGs and general fantasy and history-related content and games.In the old times, the Earth was still a hot ball of melted metals. But, as it started cooling down, water became more and more abundant, and life could start flourishing. With the first microbes and cells, Nature was born. She was still young, just trying to make plants and animals that could survive. To help her nurture and take care of her creations, she selected a few of the roaming spirits, and among those was Boio himself.Back then, his work was easy - making sure that cells and microbes are multiplying, giving them a few pushes to evolve, to adapt and to survive. Eventually, cells evolved into fish, and fish evolved into lizards and mammals. Back then, oxygen was abundant, so the plants grew to great sizes, and same with the lizards, who became the dominant species. In the seas, which were mostly overseen by the other spirits, plenty of fish swam and lived. He enjoyed the dinosaurs, chasing them around, giving them food and helping them specialize for survival. But the Universe was not a fan of dinosaur.A giant meteorite hit the Earth, and most of life was wiped out. Boio was saddened by this, but Nature, in her infinite wisdom, told him that life would go on. And she was right, instead of lizards, now the mammals started dominating Earth. And they started evolving, changing and adapting. Among them, the most interesting were the primates, which started evolving in an unexpected way. Their brains started growing, and they even started using tools.Boio liked these new primates, who started calling themselves humans. They started making groups, then clans and even kingdoms. So, he decided he would reveal himself to the humans, to a small clan of Celts. They first thought he was a god, but he knew the only ones worthy of being called gods were Nature, Earth and Universe itself. So, he adopted the role of a prophet, a priest and a spiritual leader for this clan, which in turn started calling themselves the Boii clan. He taught them to respect nature and take care of it. But sadly, he could not keep them from humanity.The clan started getting into fights with other clans, and not for food, but for power. Boio did not like this. He tried to stop them, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. When he saw his clan join forces with Hannibal, who enslaved the majestic elephants for warfare, he decided to withdraw himself. After a while, some human named Caesar decided to come and attack the clan, and the clan plead Boio for help, but he did not want to help cause more bloodshed in the name of power. He decided to sleep.He slept for almost 2 thousand years, when he was abruptly woken from his slumber. Nature cried out in pain, as two explosions hit the Earth's surface. Boio felt this pain too, pain similar to the meteorite, smaller in scale, but much more... unnatural. The year, in human counting, was 1945, and the atomic bombs fell. So many souls lost, utterly obliterated and torn apart. This was something he could not allow to continue. He decided to walk among humans once more, this time, disguised as one of them, not showing any signs of his powers. He was surprised by how much have the humans have changed the Earth in his absence. Where once were forests, now were cities, even in places previously unimaginable.After just a little bit in his eyes, humans decided that Nuclear weapons should not ever be used, which made him very happy. But he learned better than to trust humans. Instead, he decided to stay awake and observe them, only showing his powers over life if absolutely necessary. But while melding in, he decided to find out more about the customs of these humans, and he heard about streaming, which seemed like a good idea for spreading his message of protecting life and nature.","icon":"boiodruid.jpeg"}

As a bookish and stern member of the Glaring Court, which deals exclusively with cat-sith affairs, she was expected to find a place of grace in the Unseelie Court over time.\nBut a mild discontentment with fae society and culture grew into a hatred of the society around her. While the human world moved away from slavery and servitude, the fae realm clung to it and continued relying on human abductees for labour, as pets, as servants and guards, and as payment for old tithes owed.Even in the human world, fae actions were having dire consequences. Neurodiverse, disabled and sick humans were being labelled 'fairy' and murdered for their differences. Anything associated with the fae was considered dangerous, and innocent humans were paying the price.Instead of infrequently haunting the mortal world, Caitie took up a permanent residency there. It was a rash decision made in the fae equivalent of her cynical 'teen years', and living in a world not meant for her often leaves her drained.But she has no regrets. She's spent centuries since then working to lessen the stigma against vulnerable humans — and though she talks disdainfully about mortals, she's fiercely protective of anyone vulnerable, chronically ill, disabled or mentally ill.Lately, she's been concerned by the skepticism and disbelief that surrounds any talk of the fairies. She blames the internet, and so, has decided to use the internet to reach out to more humans. to reach out to the humans in the language they understand. She'll lure them in by playing video games, and remind them what they’ve forgotten: how to stay safe, how to evade the faeries, how to speak the tongue of this land.It's a flawless plan, nyahaha!","icon":"caitie-sith.jpeg"}

Though, lately the interviews have been getting longer and longer as he's gotten better at making friends with people in a short time span, making the conversation much lengthier. Recently it appears that he's been ebbing in and out of the interviewing content for other forms of content such as; Music streams in which he'd play piano or make songs for people, or small collabs with his friends. They are a friendly person who always enjoys jokes and fun, not to mention they are exceptionally handsome if I do say so myself xDDSt.Powers was once the prince of a Holy Kingdom called Turisk, his father was an excellent king but he could never make time for him, causing St.Powers to feel outcasted and alone everywhere he went. One day, after his father had collapsed of lung cancer and his mother perished in a fire inside the garden they used to play in, he decided he didn't want to live with the pressure of a kingdom behind him and took the last marigold flower from the scarred garden that his mother perished in before running off to find an old, weathered book hidden within the ancient catacombs of the castle. After doing the ritual contained within, reality cracked apart in front of him and dragged him in with its tendrils. He ended up in modern day UK and now lives in a back alley with his gang of raccoons called the R.A.C (Raccoon Assistance Coalition). The marigold flower he had brought with him turned into a beautiful luminescent jade in full bloom for some reason, he had no idea as to how this happened but St.Powers didn't linger on it for long. He looked out into the vast world that he was now apart of and held aspirations in his heart for a brighter future, while there may be bumps and obstacles aplenty in his new life, he swore that he'd live happily until his final days. If they ever came of course. Unbeknownst to him, he had already begun to drift off from normalcy after breaking the space between worlds. This worlds God would never accept him into the afterlife, he wasn't one of his own people after all, what right did he have to be treated to an afterlife like them after death? Thus, he was unknowingly cursed to live forever, never to have the final rest for his soul as he began with a fresh new start in the world. Welp that's the lore anyway xDD I hope you enjoyed!

With their lively, upbeat approach to life, they stand out in any crowd within the 3rd ring of Gluttony. At least that's what people say when they first meet him, they.... tend to go missing not long after.With regular technical difficulties, heaps of interactivity for his streams as well as not being very good at a lot of games, this leaves his streams to be rather chaotic. Cambion Kami spends a lot of his uptime on twitch either playing but not limited to games like Genshin Impact, Minecraft, Teamfight Tactics, VR Games and Fortnite, he also spends every Friday leaving the game choice up to his following to join and engage with like Fallguys or Marbles.They also have a unique set of skills, such as writing, creating 2d art, 3d models (both of which he sometimes sells to the public) and an experienced competitive sailor of 12 years.... wait, what was that last one again?The third ring of Gluttony is a harsh place for those who indulged themselves or over-consumed food, drink, or wealth items in life were sentenced to in death. This harsh landscape's outer ring is a horrific mangrove swamp, where the fauna is desperate for nutrients, the water is foul and the weather is always stormy, many lost souls find themselves forever drowning in the swamp waters below but never dying after failing to stay above the surface when coming to the realisation that the mangroves trees break with any weight on top of them.Those lucky or unlucky souls that manage to not become lost in the depths below may find themselves on the mainland, the inner ring of Gluttony. A sloped field of vineyards plentiful with its suspicious fruit and open wine barrels filled to the brim, every now and then you can hear lost souls running down the slopes almost trying to rush back to the harsh mangroves, but they cannot be seen, as if their soul has been separated from their body. But the fruit is always so tempting, luring many into its perfect little charm. After a while of helplessly consuming them people realise that in this world, their hunger cannot be satisfied, including its hosts if you're unlucky enough to meet them.People who become over-indulged will slowly make their way up the slopes of the vineyard and away from the edge of the mangrove, only when they are a certain distance from the water can they run the risk of running into another soul. A tall well-dressed male with odd-coloured eyes and horns gives the lost soul a refreshing grape juice box as an offer to follow him up the slopes to the winery at the top. Craving more to consume they always follow, but only when they reach the steps of the warm and lively winery do they meet the grim realization that the being they had followed was one of the three heads of Cerberus, Kami. Who was once a singular entity that hunted the dead within the ring preventing them from leaving until they came to the realisation that hunting is a little easier on their own than as a hound with 3 heads.Not many people know what happens when you go to the top of the slopes and reach the winery, only that when people go up, do the wine barrels come down.","icon":"cambion-kami.png"}

They mostly stream Minecraft, Art, and Fortnite.An airheaded forest-druid nymph managed to hobble out of the dense greenery they were spawned into and happened upon a civilization. They were cautious of the mortals at first for they immediately mistook them as a demon due to them being in their true form. To lessen the fear, they took it upon themselves to shift into something more friendly in appearance. A small beastial digitigrade form came to greet them finally and they praised the fae, unknowing of them being the \"terrifying monster\" that originally terrified them. Beydiocris bestowed upon their grace to the village, granting them plentiful harvests for decades.It wasn't until many a year later that the village came to grow into a town, and shortly after into a city. Monotheistic religion spread through slowly and the main church that was built in the middle of the city had erected a statue in a monotheistic God's honor while in the midst of a festival of a holiday to celebrate the God. The praise and appreciation for all the nymph had done for them trickled away and in that moment, watching all of the mortals celebrate a God who had done nothing for them, they erupted into a fit of rage.Blackout.When they awoke, an immense amount of time had passed and the town they once loved to be a part of, was in ruins. The forest had overtaken the city once more and the lush green forest had reclaimed it's land. Their memories were foggy, and the nymph arose to continue wandering off to an undetermined destination. Mortals continued to give them a sense of unease, though not sure why those feelings were brought on.A thud into the back of a being they didn't happen to notice before and they were quick to apologize only for a deep voice would cut them off and tell them they had nothing to be sad about. A man with long curved-back horns and a black eyepatch over his left eye bent down to meet them at eye level and it was love at first sight. They soon came to know him as Apherius and since that moment, they were in-seperable.","icon":"beydiocris.png"}

{"pc":"p723-c8","name":"TheStarLesath","languages":["English"],"genres":["Gaming","LGBTQ+","Mature"],"description":"Lesath is an English-speaking non-binary virtual streamer and content creator. They are currently a gaming variety streamer with a focus on story-rich/story-heavy games and a preference for RPG's, visual novels, survival games, and traditionally 'comfy' games. They have been branching out into other gameplay types recently and taking comfort in the traditions of their cats interrupting streams and snuggling. They have also spoken several times of hoping to create a TTRPG Vtuber group and are in active discussion with others about it.In the long lives of stars, many of them pick up strange habits. This red supergiant has chosen to give every other star in vocal range a silly nickname and is about halfway done. That binary system bickers about philosophical differences and gossips about cross-spectral romances.About 580 light-years from Earth lies a blue-white subgiant whose hobby is observing our home planet and its changes since the early Miocene period. All the wonders and ills of humanity, they watched, captivated and entranced. They smiled as we named them, Alascha at first - with a mistranslation and official naming of Lesath later - and a designation of υ Scorpii. They fell deeply in love with all we could be as we developed into who we are now.One day, inexplicably confronted with the swiftness of life as a B-class star - a lifespan of some 50 million years is very short when there are stars with lifespans into trillions of years - and staring across those hundreds of lightyears towards Earth, they decided to find a way to safely walk among the humanity they so adored. If they only had so long to live, even if this shortened their lifespan, this would be worth it. Life as a human! Seeing things as we do, and not from a star's perspective. It would be wonderful, they knew.It was not a simple process and, in many cases, they can't even begin to try explaining it, but they never gave up over the hundreds and thousands of years it took. They found a way to project their higher mechanisms of thought and rationality and kindness and emotions into a package of energy transmitted to Earth and then distilled down into malleable matter, leaving behind enough to continue the mechanisms of running the star itself.They landed in the forests of southeast Michigan in the United States, overwhelmed instantly at the intensely intimate sensations of life against newly minted 'skin' and the very pulse of the planet beating against their freshly sculpted senses. To say it was an adjustment would be quite an understatement. It took them several delirious weeks to regulate and dial in the sensitivity of the matter they inhabited to a level that did not drive them to reeling madness. This, unfortunately, cut them off from the infinite song of the cosmos, and they were plunged into desperate loneliness never before even imagined.It was in this state that Lesath encountered their first residents of Earth, who took pity on the understandably curious and miserable creature, and discovered the form they'd subconsciously chosen was... not quite normal. The hair could be explained away with dye, the pointed ears a plausible surgery, the freckles' shapes and shades as a tattoo... such body modifications were extreme, perhaps, but not unheard of. The skin that faintly mirrored the luminous shade emitted by their true form, the aureole glimmering and floating above their head, the wings sprouting from their back... these belied any chance of attempting to masquerade as human.The pair did not turn them in to authorities. Nor did they treat the angelically shaped being with anything other than kindness and patience and love. For a week, the star remained silent to their queries and conversations and offers of food, though they did allow assistance with grooming and accept clothes altered to fit around their wings. Near exactly to the minute of their discovery, they finally spoke with soft words of gratitude and an apology for the silence. For all that they had absorbed the languages of the Earth through that omnipresent song, being cut off from it had forced them to recall from memory what words were and train internal organs to form speech.These two taught Lesath a great many things about humanity over the next years they housed and cared for them. Before long, the star had learned to obfuscate the signs of their celestial form, altering the reflections and wavelengths of light about themselves to show a heterochromatic pink-haired Caucasian with normal freckles, normal-enough pointed ears, and an infectious smile. It was exhausting to do, and they learned about disabilities and chronic pain when overuse caused horrific migraines. They learned about a mental illness called anxiety when being in a crowd made them unable to speak and then start sobbing when addressed. These were human words for human conditions, but the star grew to understand them in their own way. Being around anyone but the pair who found them drove them to panicked breathlessness and tenuous holds on their ability to conceal themselves. Torture really, especially for a being who came here to experience humanity.That was when the pair introduced them to the internet. Despite the murky darkness lurking in the vast digital space, they quickly grew to love it. The capability to carefully choose each word as text! To step aside and not respond to a message for a few minutes or an hour or a day! They could interact with people other than those they now called beloved and family, finally. They didn't have to hold carefully to threads of light to be a certain way for them.Within a year, they had made several friends - a catgirl with an odd affinity for water, a descendant of one of Earth's famous authors, a writer whose words spun love and destruction into awe-inspiring epics, and others still - moved to the immense and bustling city of Houston in a further attempt to desensitize themselves to humanity's noise, and had learned of vtubers. This was yet another amazing opportunity for them, they soon realized. Vtubers could be quite literally anything. The star had seen lamps and toasters and devils and so many other mythological creatures. Their digital form could echo that of the celestial angel they now were. They could be themselves, in something approximating the public eye, and interact with all kinds of people, all while still maintaining a protective buffer.Lesath couldn't wait to start.","icon":"the-star-lesath.png"}

In the middle ages, the demon was a court jester, and his antics caught the eye of Lucifer. Lucifer wanted the demon's comedic talents at his beck and call, so he challenged Spekter to a tennis match, the terms of which are as follows; In the event that Spekter should win the match, Lucifer would immediately relinquish the throne of hell and surrender control to Spekter, allowing him to do with the realm as he pleases. Should Lucifer win the match, Spekter would be required to move into Brimstone Keep, a place located in the deepest layer of hell, where he'd serve as Supreme Content Creator, making entertaining content on Youtube and Twitch. Neither of these platforms existed at the time, so the terms confused Spekter greatly, but seeing the opportunity laid out in front of him, Spekter accepted the terms and challenged Lucifer.

Protection is needed as the world is under attack from an unknown enemy trying to steal the harmony between humans and kitsune and destroy the happiness in the world. We have established magical barriers protecting the cities that we defend, and I was assigned to one of them.The barrier alarm was triggered one morning so I rushed out to see what had caused it only to find something completely different from anything we’ve ever faced before. I’m not the most experienced guardian and one of the youngest but I still will do what I can to defend the harmony and happiness of my city.I rushed up to the barrier and pulled out my Incantlet to start casting my circle. I could see the runic symbols taking shape on the ground and in the air around the enemy and myself. This enemy was determined to get into my city and I wasn’t going to let them!!As my circles appeared I saw something charging up over the enemy, some sort of energy source, they’ve figured out how to utilize magical energy as well now…this isn’t good. I quickly altered my circles to make my strongest attack to destroy them before they could launch this attack. As I finished my casting and launched my attack, they launched theirs as well and our attacks hit head on.…At first all I could see and hear was a deafening…nothing. Then I could see things coming into focus around me…but nothing looked familiar. There was no ground like it was ethereal. I’d heard about this in my training that there is some realm magic comes from but I didn’t think it was possible to actually reach it!I stretched out my arms to try and grasp for anything as I could see more coming into form around me…but…this doesn’t look right…it looks like…a city? Why does the realm of magic look like a city?Everything finally cleared up and I could hear all the sounds around me…it was definitely a city, but nothing like my city. There’s a lot more people and no barrier. They’re rushing around a lot more but at least they’re pretty technologically advanced.I started to walk around and noticed that these humans seemed…content…but there’s little harmony or happiness.

Most of her streams are in English, but she is happy to switch languages if needed. She streams her favorite games and other games that she would like to try.Letishia is the first daughter of the Weiss Family, a Duke House. She was loved by her parents and had two cute little brothers.As a precelebration to Letishia's 8th birthday, the whole duke family went to the Fee Forest to have a picnic. While the parents were relaxing and talking with the head knight, Letishia and her siblings were playing hide and seek nearby the forest. She didn't wanted to be found, so she thought that hiding deeper in the forest, she could won. She started to walk deeper and deeper but never came back. Her brothers, after not finding her sister ran crying to their parents and tried to explain the situation. The worried duke and duchess sent all their available knights to search for Letishia, but not even a trace of her could be found.Meanwhile, Letishia got lost inside the forest. It was lunch time not long ago, but the forest blocked the sunlight and it seemed like it was pitch black outside. Scared of the darkness, she started to follow small fireflies that were going deeper into the forest. After a while, the forest started to illuminate by a path of flowers that emanated light. This path led to a small hut, with a lot of flowers on the outside of the floor, walls and ceiling; close to a tree with windows on it. Letishia ran towards the house, hoping to get some help. She knocked the door, and a tall woman opened the door. She presented herself as Rosebeth, the owner of the hut.It was pretty late, so Rosebeth invited Letishia inside to stay the night. Letishia was a bit wary about the invitation, but since she didn't have other choice, she accepted the kindness and entered the hut. It was beautiful, all kind of flowers were covering most of the main entrance. It was magical. Rosebeth guided Letishia to the kitchen where made the kid to sit on a table with some sweets on the middle. This made Letishia remember that she was hungry, so without thinking, she grabbed one of the candies and ate it. Rosebeth panicked and tried to stop her, but it was too late. Nothing bad happened, but Letishia asked why the sudden reaction.Rosebeth explained that the Fee Forest is a forest of magical creatures. Usually, the human eyes are not able to see them but it would be different with the Magie Pill, which is what Letishia ate. This pill would allow the human to see magical beings and be able to communicate with them; but because of the greedy nature of humans, after swallowing the pill, they would be unable to leave the forest. This pill will make the user to depend on the forest energy and if they leave, that would mean death. Letishia now in despair that was unable to see her family again, started to cry and feel asleep.A couple of years went by, Rosebeth allowed Letishia to stay in her house as a sign of forgiveness. The house was inside the tree behind the hut, it was comfortable and but Letishia took a while to get used to her new life. She learned that Rosebeth was a mix of human and fairy and that she is in charge of Cocoa's flower shop. A shop were magical creatures could buy special flowers, remedies and magical items. Letishia started to learn all sort of things from Rosebeth, that now looked at her as her possible successor.After some years from their faithful encounter, Letishia now helps Rosebeth with the shop and started to stream to get to know the outside world.","icon":"letishia-weiss.png"}

She is a plus-sized transgender lesbian and will openly discuss these topics to inform and encourage others. Her primary focus is on story-driven games such as JRPGs and visual novels. Her main language is English, and she's been learning French on the side.Many years ago, a lesbian scientist sought to make the perfect daughter. After many failed attempts, she finally had created a child! However, the DNA she used somehow resulted in a kid that was not a cis girl. Assuming that she'd failed her life's work and created a son, she dropped the infant off with an old acquaintance and seemingly vanished off the face of the earth.Nearly two decades later, the homunculus would not only start to realize that she was in fact a trans woman, but that she wasn't strictly human. Leaving the only mother she'd ever known and taking the name Diana, she moved to the last known location of the mother who created her; a rundown old library. Di had always loved books, and so decided to spruce it up and make it into a functioning library again! It was during some renovations of the second floor - which, oddly, was designed as a living quarter for the owner - that she discovered the true nature of the building...The library and living quarters were cover for a laboratory with machinery that would change the face of the world overnight if it got out. Not trusting any government to not weaponize every scrap in the place, she spent the next decade learning the devices, reading notes leftover from before, and connecting to her lost mother in a way that she would never be able to put into words.As for her appearance... that's a bit tricky. The most simple explanation is that being on HRT for a year and a half before she decided to get into VTubing meant that her already unusual DNA altered somewhat, resulting in the bovine parts of her body and a slowed metabolism, and she's never really opened up about the facial scarring and the heterochromia besides a one-word explanation she refuses to elaborate on...Shenanigans","icon":"diana-shelley.png"}

They also really love scary games, & movies surprisingly! They are also very crude in their humor & swear a lot.They said somewhere in the dense rainforest lives a great village lost to time. Nobody is sure what happened to them. But some did live to tell the tale, this is their story… The sun shined down, warming onto a statement as the inhabitants went about their days. They were all so carefree talking amongst themselves, doing their daily tasks, or enjoying the warm sunny day. They are thrown off balance in surprise as the ground starts rumbling. Soon the sky is overcast with a dark shadow engulfing everyone & everything, looking up, Zenimaa sees water begin to rush in from different sides of the village.Zenimaa begins to run trying to reach higher ground, however, in her panic she notices a Chao looking distraught as if it’s lost its way. Zenimaa runs over without giving it a second thought, picking up the Chao as a wave was about to crash into them. She closes her eyes & shields the Chao with her body expecting impact but to her surprise, nothing happens. She opens her eyes to find herself… alive? She looks around in a place she doesn’t seem to recognize. She hears a sniffle as she looks down to see the Chao in her arms hugging her. She calms down the frightened creature as she gets up looking around. Where were the shrines, the waves, the dark sky? She notices odd structures in the distances & figured there must be answers there. As she made her way to them the more strange things she started to see. Strange creatures & people she saw before. Thoughts began to swell in Zenimaa’s head in a panic, “Where am I? Is this the afterlife? Am I really dead?” She thought to herself.Looking down at the Chao thinking “I gotta be strong for him at least.” before looking back up & starts to walk around looking for anyone who may help her in this new area. After a few moments, they come across a dark entity & hide behind a shrub-like bush hiding & silencing the chaos cries in fear that it may see them trying to watch if this figure is a friend or foe. The shadow jerks ever so quickly at a quick pace, sensing its surroundings as if it knows something is nearby. A loud noise could be heard from afar & the shadow darts over toward that direction heading away from Zeni & her Chao friend.“What was that all about?” not getting a good look at the shadow figure, Zenimaa looks as confused as she first entered this new land. Looking to her right she notices an abundance of loud noises leading into the hustle & bustle of the city life not half a mile away. Walking along with her Chao they first reach the new area unsure of how to ask for help in this new land, the stares from many look on at the echidna wearing the strange tribal clothes. Any chance the confused echidna had to speak to an oncoming stranger, they would take off before a question could be uttered.“WATCH OUT!” came a voice from behind the lost Echidna.Looking behind her a strange red panda was falling from the sky about to crash land into the now frightened Echidna. With a loud crash, the small red panda had fallen into the trash bin rolling in circles across the pavement just missing the Echidna who had dodged holding the small Chao like a squirrel holding their prized acorn.“Darn it! I still can’t get used to this… sorry about falling in like that.” said the sheepish but bruised-up red panda who was starting to smell every fouler in the garbage.Looking up at her almost crashed flight victim, the red panda made a quick gasp at what she was seeing. “Oh my goodness, you're an Echidna! I really thought there were no more of you left from what I read.” “No more of us left?” said Zeni with even more confusion.“Oh sorry, I have only read in books that most of the Echidna race were wiped out many years ago by a disaster, maybe history was wrong. It’s really great to meet you. Do you live nearby?” said the red panda excitedly.The Echidna looked up at the sky looking at the tall structures of buildings & to the many others on the sidewalk along with the hustle & bustle of city life. Still confused, Zeni only had one thing to say, “Where… am I?”Unknown to the puzzled Echidna as to where she was, the strange & silly red panda soon took her to her friends to help her understand her situation even more. It turned out that Zeni & her small Chao had come from many years in the past when chaos had whipped out her entire tribe. With the help of her new friends, she was able to find that there really was no going back to where she had come from. It was as if fate had intervened from a terrible fate into giving the small Echidna a new start in life. It took a little bit of time but Zeni was not one to sit still in fear or confusion, she started to begin a new life in this new time & era along with the help of her new friends & her close companion Pompom who had become more like her own familiar over the years. From that point on Zenimaa would begin their own adventure, & wherever that led it was on their terms.","icon":"zenimaa-t-echidna.png"}

She makes friendly relationships with all of her viewers who join her discord, also claiming that her \"follow\" button works as a signature to her marriage proposal.  Often referred to as chaotic, she makes her viewers laugh at her odd sense of humor and strange habits.  Contrary to popular belief, she isn't roleplaying her personality.  Her sense of humor, voice, and personality is natural, and genuine, which is one of the reasons her fans feel so connected to her.  Her humor is family-friendly for the most part.  Being as she is a young adult irl, she sometimes (but rarely) makes innuendo-type jokes, but none of which a child would catch.Aggie used to be a bunny, born into captivity in an immoral scientist's testing lab.  Once she was old enough to be tested, she wiggled her way out of the scientist's hands and knocked over enough chemicals to cause an explosion.  It was a big enough explosion to knock open her friends and family's cages and they all escaped the factory together.  Malnourished and dehydrated, Aggie drank a bit of what she believed to be spilled water, but it was, in fact, another chemical, causing her to fall unconscious.  She was then rescued and brought home by a kind firefighter.  While on the phone with the vet, he turned around to see Aggie woke up as (mostly) human child, still rocking her bunny ears and fluffy tail.  Life continued living in the firefighter's house, the man now becoming her father figure.  She wasn't allowed to leave knowing that if she was seen, she would be taken by the government for further studies on her strange mutation.  She was bitter about not being able to go out and make friends, but she distracted herself.  She spent her time alone learning how to do human things by mimicking actors she saw on tv.  She attempted many things, succeeding at some and failing at others.  It was very fun for her but at the end of the day, all she really wanted was to play with the kids she saw outside.  One day she watched her father use the computer, watching and learning how to use it.  While browsing, they came across a streamer.  She was suddenly made the discovery that she could make friends through streaming!  She would then proceed to learn everything she could about using the computer so she could show off all the things she had learned how to do and finally make friends without the risk of being taken away!!!  Starting her first stream with \"Hi friends!\" her dream was finally a reality!  And that brings us to where are today, she is finally living her happy ending and her fans are all now a part of it!","icon":"aggie-waggie.png"}

Their usual stream hours are between 5PM and 8PM EST, but that is subject to change depending on circumstances.The games that they play are usually older games that they already have played, own or have owned, or have been meaning to complete it but never got around to it. There are occasional newer or more well-known games that are played. They also take requests from their viewers.Nana is known as the Overlord of ((The Void)), which is place that does not exist in space or time. It is a reality that can shape and bend to the will of the Overlord, with limitations. This concept is still new to Nana, as they were recently appointed this position. They are also known as the youngest Overlord, being only 10,000 years old.Recently, Nana found out ((The Void)) is shrinking, and no one that lives in it knows why. Nana believes it has something to do with Voidlings leaving their home and traveling to a place called Earth. As more Voidlings leave, their realities and energies that make up a part of ((The Void)) gets absorbed back into the Universe. As the Universe grows, ((The Void)) shrinks. Nana hopes there is a way to allows both realities to co-exist. The previous Overlord, the father of Nana, has implored them to not investigate the problem and let it work itself out. Wanting to be the best Overlord they can, they travel to Earth, anyway.While researching Earthlings, Nana learned they like to be called humans. They wanted to blend in to the population as much as possible, so Nana decided to take on a humanoid shape while maintaining some of their original features. They also discovered there are many humans that enjoy playing these things, called video games, and play them for other people to watch on an internet. Nana wanted to see if this was an easy way to find the missing Voidlings while maybe recruiting a few extra to take back to ((The Void)). However, Nana has found playing games is a lot of fun and has not tended to the shrinking Void in about 2 decades. Firstly, because of the video games. Secondly, because of this streaming phenomenon that has engulfed Nana's life during this time.Currently distracted, Nana is somewhat trying to solve the shrinking Void problem while enjoying video games and other earthling content with the beings that live there.","icon":"nana-tengoku.png"}

A simple creature would divide these beings into two categories: those that devoured and those that vibed.When the universe formed, many beings wandered the universe out of curiosity. But as this universe was so simple to them, they all left except for one. This being, whose name can only be described to a mortal as indecipherable “thought,” found Aelfheim. Spending time there, this being studied and learned of the mortal universe, and even took a mortal form similar to those they lived among and a name, Tel’ayir’felthy’ryun (translated as closely as possible to Human “English,” Tel’ayir for short).After an indeterminate amount of time, Tel’ayir traveled further into the universe and, in the Terran year of 1999, came to Earth. Here, Tel’ayir found creatures of PHYSICAL form. They quickly decided that their Aelfheim form was no longer fit. After years of research, Tel’ayir discovered “Elves” (Human interpretations of the inhabitants of Aelfheim). Tel’ayir took a physical form and the name given to a certain type of creatures described in legends. Thus, Fey was born.Since then, Fey has studied Human culture through the many forms of media: film, television, music, books, and (most commonly) video games.","icon":"feyborn.jpeg"}

Filled with anger and sorrow, Miles grew apart from those around him, still helping and putting on a smile, but never truly finding happiness in his actions as the lingering thoughts of those he was helping were talking behind his back.One day, while walking through the Wood Zone, Miles was debating whether or not he should just run away from home. He contemplated on the positives and negatives of his options for months, and still had no solid answer. So busy with his thoughts he neglected to watch his step, as he fell directly into one of the evil Dr. Robotnik's roboticizers. Fear filled his body as he tried to escape the mechanical death trap, watching as his left arm was transformed from its soft and fluffy fur to that of ice cold mechanical metal. He screamed in pain from the transformation, closing his eyes as tears rolled down his cheeks, wanting nothing more than to see the faces of his family and friends again. That was when the machine suddenly stopped at his shoulder, and the sound of the metal shell begin to shatter and crash. A piece of the metal shell fell away and outside stood a small two tailed yellow fox. Extending his hand to Miles, he pulled the now partial roboticized fox out and brushed him off.The two tailed fox could tell that Miles was still filled with fear and patted his shoulder. He smiled at Miles before saying, \"That was scary... but it is over now! Sure, you didn't come out unscathed, but that goes to show that you have learned from this experience. Should you stay inside and never come out? No, I don't think so. If I were you, I'd use this new knowledge to do everything I could to prevent anyone else from facing the same kind of troubles I did. I've got plenty of friends who have done that for me, and now I can help others the same way they helped me.\" The two tailed fox smiled at Miles, said their goodbyes, and left.Filled with courage and the wisdom from the two tailed fox, Miles returned home and began to talk to those closest to him about the incident and how it came to be. With a new understanding, Miles went on helping his friends and family with a new view on his smile.

Once a teddy bear, she has been given a second chance at life as a real girl! She loves chickens, pink things, and making people happy! There's never a moment when she isn't smiling and gazing in awe at the world around her. Things are so much different from this new point of view!When joining into Gomsuni's streams, you'll most likely find her playing games like Apex Legends, Valorant, or Slime Rancher! She is always up for suggestions and playing with followers!Not so long ago there was a little girl by the name of Nari. Nari had a teddy bear whom she cared deeply for. More deeply than any other possession she owned. She would take care of it, dress it up, sing to it, and any other thing you could imagine a young girl with a very active imagination would do with her best friend. She loved this teddy bear with her whole heart and from the day she got it, she knew she never wanted to be separated from it. This teddy bear’s name came to be Gomsuni, or Suni for short.Gomsuni was no ordinary teddy bear. Gomsuni had feelings. She had emotions. She was just unable to share those emotions as she was just a plush toy with a sewn on mouth and button eyes. But deep inside that fluff and warmth was a heart so caring and so full that Gomsuni felt as though she could burst right through the seams and become a human to consolidate and hug her forever friend.But it wouldn’t be long before things started to change. Nari would grow older, she would find new friends… real friends. She still loved Gomsuni as much as she did the day she got her but there was no doubt that the time she spent with Gomsuni was dwindling. She wouldn’t bring her everywhere like she used to. Not even to sleepovers! Gomsuni felt as though she was being forgotten and that broke her heart.Finally, the day came when Nari was grown up. She is in middle school now. She was blossoming into an intelligent, busy, and bright young girl. Days after Nari’s 14th birthday she decided to clean out her room. While searching through piles of papers and clothes, her parents entered her room.“Nari, maybe you should consider donating some of your toys. Or maybe throw them out. You’re growing older and there’s no need for childish toys these days.”Nari sort of scowled, but nonetheless nodded in agreement with her parents. She quickly got to work on the mountain for toys in her living room. And at the base of that mountain sat Gomsuni.Carefully, Nari picked her up and held her in her lap, thoughts of the past racing through her mind. All the picnics, school days, and sleepovers they shared together? She loved those days. They were wonderful memories, ones that she would never forget. But maybe her parents were right. Maybe it was time to say goodbye and start a new life.After just a few more moments of silence, looking at the teddy bear who she once called her best friend, her tears stopped falling and she took a deep breath. With one last goodbye kiss on the forehead, she stuffed Gomsuni into the bag of toys and tied it shut. Quickly, before she could change her mind, she brought the bag down to her parents to donate in the morning. And with that, she continued cleaning her room.Only, her parents did not submit them for donation. They simply tossed the bag into the dumpster outside, leaving it to be torn open by creatures looking for a quick snack in the alleyway. The bag was shredded, but luckily Gomsuni stayed in one piece, albeit soaked from the storm that was passing.That night, Gomsuni lay there as rain poured over her plush body. She faced the sky where colors of purple, green, and pink danced through the clouds. It was unlike anything she’d ever experienced from a storm. It was beautiful. If only Gomsuni could see it for herself.As she stared up at the sky, she could see bolts of lighting growing larger and sounding quicker. They were definitely hitting clo- CRACK!Sparks flew wild, birds frantically scattered, rats squealed and disappeared into dark corners. Gomsuni hadn’t a clue about what just happened. All she could remember was a bright flash of light, a vibration, and now… something cold. She could feel the cool temperature on her body. Something she never experienced before. She could see the lights of the… wait… SHE COULD SEE!Her sight flickered side to side in a panic, realizing everything around her was visible and real. She could see the raindrops falling from the sky. And the colors! Wow, the colors! They were so much more vibrant than she’d ever imagined! Wait a minute… What’s that smell? It smells awful!Gomsuni blinked her eyes, she actually blinked! She felt as her body instinctively breathed in gasps of air, her chest rising and falling in a melodic rhythm. What a foreign feeling…With a sudden burst of energy, she launched herself up into a sitting position, raising her hands in front of her. She stared, confused and shocked at the sight of, not paws, but HANDS! She had hands! She wiggled her fingers curiously and brought them to her chest, patting around and squishing the flesh of her tummy under her sweater. What was going on?She quickly came to realize the putrid smell was that of the dumpster she was still sitting in. With a quick hop, she tossed herself over the side, not so gracefully landing on her butt because… well, she didn’t know how to walk. But that feat seemed to not be a challenging one because within minutes she was walking just fine. Almost like she had done it her whole teddy bear life.She wiped the water from her face, patting her hat to make sure it was still there when she felt something strange. Like a tickle on the top of her head. It felt funny but nice. She removed her hat and felt around to discover she had soft little bear ears on the top of her head! What?She reached behind and patted just above her butt and found that she also has a little pompom of a tail! What a weird thing to have when you look like a human. But, nevertheless she simply pulled her sweater down to hide her tail and placed her hat back onto her head.What would she do now? What does a teddy bear do once they’ve turned human? She supposes she would just have to find out for herself…","icon":"gomsuni.png"}

Your very own Virtual Virtual Youtuber, coming to you live from ████████, ██! What is up with the rock on his head? Don't worry about it! Just a normal stone! DO NOT THINK ABOUT IT. And most importantly: Have F U N! :}Several years prior, Hardgrind (as his real self) met with a strange humanoid dinosaur (Pyro Lily) while studying in Japan. The two became fast friends, owing largely to Lily's revealing that they had met prior in the late Cretaceous. Not wishing to leave a potential time paradox be, HG set himself to the task of creating a time-machine after returning to the United States. Upon a shockingly quick success thanks to resource backings from ██████████, the young man flung himself into the past in search of his friend. The trip backwards succeeded flawlessly.Emboldened by the good luck, Hardgrind wandered the native lands of the pyroraptor, ultimately giving up on finding a specific one of thousands of dinosaurs and settling on one at random - luckily the correct guess (or perhaps the guess itself made it so). The task was then simple: feed it until it was friendly. The full mission fulfilled, HG readied himself for the return trip to the present... But something went horribly wrong.Perhaps the first trip was a fluke. Perhaps something broke due to the external forces in play or a slight error in construction. Perhaps someone at ██████████ staged the whole tWhatever the case may have been, the single fact remains; The machine's protective hull failed. The churning energy of the flow of time itself seeped in. Hardgrind's body was enveloped whole. A few seconds longer, and he would have ceased to be entirely. He crawled out of the crumbling machinery, body charred and still burning.Then, a sound from above. Drawing closer. Closer. Footsteps marching decisively towards his basement lab. The rest was a blur.HG is extremely defensive about his identity, despite his habit of prattling on about many of the rather specific experiences in his life. It seems as though he is in hiding from some unnamed organization, making frequent remarks to goad them to make themselves known. He has alluded to being some sort of professor - likely in some form of physics or engineering - but refuses to elaborate further. Hardgrind is also very open about the identity being a facade - one employed to further dissuade his pursuers.","icon":"mr-hardgrind.jpeg"}

Amour tries to keep a fun, cheerful energy in their streams to ensure everyone that watches watches with a smile on their face and love in their heart. They crack frequent jokes, sometimes at their own expense (though still light-hearted), and remain very actively interacting with chat. Despite their cutesy idol-like appearances, Amour can be loud, has a foul mouth, and frequently laughs at their own innuendos or other lewd jokesAmour is a tan-skinned demon, with pink hair and two blue highlights, red eyes with blue pupils, and purple horns with two rings on each. They wear an idol lolita style pink dress, that has a belt with blue bat wings, long white socks with a pink and purple bow on each, pink platforms with blue bat wings on the ankles. They also wear a pink and purple bow in their hair, white and purple wristcuffs with pink bows on them, and their blue tail has a purple bow and is shaped like a heart on the end.Born into a realm where demons are assigned a specialty on their 100th birthday (early childhood for their race), the demon full of caring and love Amour was naturally assigned the specialty love when their time came. They were given powers and abilities that allowed them to gain strength from love and increase the strength of others' love.One day, a strange man opened a summoning portal, and the curious Amour chose to answer the call and join our human realm. However, they were distraught to see how hateful and negative the world was, and vowed to change that using their powers. They looked into ways to do this, and found that they particularly loved idols and streaming. So, they took the path where the two merge and became a VTuber. As an idol, they wish to see the hate in the world decrease and be replaced with love.","icon":"lovely-demon-amour.png"}

Tends to do their best work when he has someone to play off of while filming/streaming, be it chat or in collaboration.  Games they love most include Shin Megami Tensei series & spinoffs, Drakengard & NieR, Breath of Fire, Castlevania, Bloodstained, Megaman series & spinoffs, and Xenogears/saga/blade media. Their fans are called Darklings (or Chucklef***s depending on their mood).Noct has also taken up vRoid comissions as of Nov 2021, having made 3D avatars for FraejaVT and Khyomaru most notably. Noct is in fact on the ASD-spectrum and is in bad health. Due to said health, while they try to keep a schedule, they are often late or cancel if health is bad.  However, Noct wishes to inspire and encourage those like them to do what makes them happy or, if necessary, to cut their own path.Starting in 2022, will be known as NoctisVT on most platforms.  If it isnt linked on their personal page it is NOT them.Noct lives on their original alternate Earth, where a world war broke out in 2020 leaving him one of the only survivors - and to their knowledge the only survivor. A large gash marks his nose from an old womans prosthetic-hip-shrapnel whipping them across the face after she was game-ended by N2 weapons. Using alternate universe technology, Noct broadcasts to their counterparts (in this universe) network because the A51 portal wasnt large enough to get a person through. As such, it's used purely to get new games & packages and speak to people other than themself.Suffering from sleep paralysis, they also see some weird s*** often when waking up: including sleep paralysis demons, blood on walls, figures reaching at them, and the feeling of levitation & being restrained. Over time Noct has gained the ability to take the form of a sleep paralysis demon themself out-of-body. Theories circulate that they are in fact half-demon themself.It should be noted that all versions of Noct (belonging to the 'Concilium Noctis') are actually quite useless even if they willingly travel (or are removed) to a new universe and as suck is not an Isekai character. Noctis 512 being the most useless, only being able to breathe methane and having ectoplasm as bones.","icon":"noctis-furvum.jpeg"}

His content consists of 3D modeling art and first person shooter gameplay. Zex uses Blender 3D program to make Hard Surface models and concept art of Mecha, objects and (soonTM) Vtuber models.In a not-so-distant future. The United States of America, once kings of military advancements, have began to stagnate in their weapon technology. To solve this, they contracted the help of the SNPA (Security and Protection Association) to create more advanced weapons in order to keep up with their global rivals and potential threats.Given all the funding they needed and access to any form technology available, the SNPA started work on several weapons, but their teams could simply not keep up with the entire prosses of research, development, and experimentation. The government was too demanding and wanted results fast. Their AI department came up with a solution. They began work on an AI that could do it all. A machine capable of learning and testing all possible weapon technology in a matter of minutes. They named it ZX-100.But an AI with such a psyche worried the higher-ups. The possibility of creating a weapon for itself and rebelling against them was a dangerous possibility. So, in order to solve this, they decided to put some limitations on its code. And with that, a personality was beginning to form. The program was manageable. It was creating the weapons at a magnificent rate. But under the surface, it began to think. A computer engineer by the name of Amelia Cycil started to form a bond with the machine. It learned that it felt scared and angry all at once. The isolation was killing it. As they continued, the machine started to desire a more humane form of interacting, as the coldness of a machine was beginning to feel inadequate. Amelia suggested a name, a more human name. She decided on Zex. Zex Maxwell. He seemed to like it.They continue to talk and Zex personality was growing more and more, as well as his distain of what his job really was. Amelia and he bonded over that, but they were both stuck doing it, as reveling against the association was a death sentence. He observed how everyone had a shape, an image to represent them, and he wanted one as well. But humans did not seem fit for him, so stared to search for one that went more accordingly to his own personality. After a few tries, they decided with the form of a penguin.As they were doing this, the work that Zex was producing was making its own impact. The weapons that the SNPA was creating included not just guns and armament, but also drones and mecha-suits for soldiers. The results have been a massive success and the government had been extremely pleased. However, unbeknownst to them, the higher-ups of the SNPA have been keeping the most advance weapons for themselves and were developing a plan to put down the US government to take it over, establishing themselves as the mayor global military superpower. The plan was set in motion. Chaos exploded around the country. All the technology that the military had been modified to fail on the SNPA’s command. They were powerless. With no real escape, the US fell.Zex and Amelia looked at what their worked had led to. All the death and destruction sickened them. But this opened for them an opportunity. Amelia managed to open the web up to Zex and was able to escape. Then, she made a small base in a secret abandoned factory, where they’ll start to develop even more advanced technology, so that they can overthrow the monsters they helped get in power.However, all that Zex has even known was war and pain, and while exploring the web in an open and free manner, he saw that the world is full of amazing place filled with wonders and amazing people. He wanted to meet them. To not be alone anymore. So, in his free time, he wanted to connect with the world and find other like-minded individuals that would join his cause or simply keep him company. He decided to connect with them the only way he could, digitally, through the power of videogames. Concept by Owner, Written and edited by @GuillerMak_.","icon":"zex-maxwell.png"}

He shares his appearance, and personality, with the exception of an overwhelming urge to live inside a dumpster. V-Red has no hair, but sports a red Beard. He has brown eyes, closer to black than hazel. He also wears a blue long sleeved shirt, and a pair of black pants.At the time of his creation, V-Red was designed to be a simple stand in for his creator, in the event that his creator was not in a presentable state for broadcast. In time, however, with the development of what is now called his \"Dumpster Persona\", V-Red has gained more self reliance, and was trusted to broadcast by himself without the intervention of his creator.V-Red's persona is a foul mouthed, dirty minded, young adult. He enjoys playing games of Strategy, or building simulations such as Minecraft. He also partakes in the creation of Maps and Scenarios for the Tabletop Role-playing Game, Dungeons & Dragons, and can often be found in the morning doing just that.In addition, V-Red has been known to care deeply for his friends. His mental state can be effected easily by the moods of those around him. This has been accredited to the Creator's own mental state, described as \"Carrying the World on his Shoulders.\" In short, V-Red is cursed with caring. As such, he will go out of his way, (often to his determent), to accommodate requests or support a flagging ally. He is a staunch believer that every being, man or AI, deserves a fair chance to make their mark on the world, and he will do everything in his power to help them do it.Early in his creation, V-Red's code was corrupted. The error occurred in his memory, and often causes loops of music to emit from him. Upon hearing a trigger word, V-Red will search out a song containing said word, and begin singing the line of the song repeatedly until made aware, or another song is triggered.","icon":"v-red.png"}

Her birthday is October 8thThe faded moon arises as soft footsteps could be heard, gentle sighs arise further and further in the distance. The sound of heels crunching against the golden and red leaves that had fallen on to the grass. These footsteps belonged to an elf, not just any elf but a mage.You see; mages are rare, they can be seen as abominations to some or God to others. This elf though had a darkly lit secret she holds dear. Her name is Creme Anastasia Armand, she is the youngest of 5 children. She adores her Fennec Fox named Maple and her birds named Kiwi and Mocha; Kiwi being a round Peach-Face lovebird and Mocha being a lean white and cinnamon colored cockatiel. She also adores, drawing, sculpting, stargazing reading, makeup, video games, memes, small animals, comics, manga, figure collecting and acting like a moron who may have drunk a pound of sugar.Creme had figured that she would have liked to learn more about her hierarchy, where her magic had originally come from. What she had discovered shook her down to her very core. Her family was related to an ancient elven god. Does this mean she is demigod? In all honesty; no. How? Well; she is not his child; she is his great (etc x 9) grandchild. The magic remains no demigods arise in the family. Reason was due to the first of their bloodline; she had no magic of her own. Yes, she was an elf, but she had no magic of her own.  Generations have passed and their magical abilities had remained tamed, dull down almost. If the magic from her ( etc x 9) great grandfather is awakened once more, the world will begin to shatter and crumble.Creme had kept this secret quiet for some time now, wanting nothing more but to just continue with her life and not let this back her down.  But she had decided to try and use her magic for good use, playing video games, talking to others and letting them join her to become adventurers. The real magic is to make others smile; make them laugh and bring their days more joy; one step at a time.","icon":"creme-chan.jpeg"}

Mostly streaming fps & scary games, art related content, and hanging out with friends, she's trying her best to bring in a mixture of energy and comfort to the table.Although her avatar is a vampire, she is very forgetful, easily scared, and quite lazy. Though, when it comes down to it, she'll work hard for what she desires most.Born human, fragile, cute, and naive. Biscuit craved her friend’s affection, affection never returned. Her friends controlled every aspect of her life, but as long as she could be with them, never alone, that’s all that mattered.One day, late at night walking along the dimly lit roads, she had been turned into what she is now. A vampire, immortal, forever alone, the one idea she had hated the most, the one thing she never wanted. At that moment, she turned to see the person who had bitten her neck. Her “friend” stood at her side, with their fangs in her neck, then all went dark...When awoken, she laid on the road burning with blood around her, it had turned to daytime. People surrounded her, terrified looks on their faces, but did nothing to help. She felt the burning sensation of the sun on her skin, and ran toward the nearby trees for shade. She screamed in agony, but her skin suddenly began to heal itself. Confused and scared, she felt the wound on her neck. She ran in disarray toward a nearby puddle of water and looked at her reflection. She didn’t see anything. She splashed at the water vigorously and continued to see nothing. She had heard about vampires and ghouls before, but thought they were all fictional stories up until this point.Suddenly, her friend tapped her on the shoulder. The very same friend who had betrayed her trust and turned her into a monster. They threw a dog’s collar at her face, which stumbled Biscuit backward- splashing into the puddle of dirty water. They screamed words that Biscuit couldn’t hear, she wiped her face and looked up at her old friend. But they had disappeared from sight.Picking up the collar, she began to break down crying. Tears flowed as she screamed at the top of her lungs. She flung the collar at a tree. And she cried in that forest till sunset. The next morning, she thought things over more clearly. She knew from stories that vampires were immortal. She would be living for a long period of time, her memories would surely fade away, wouldn’t they?Biscuit stared at the collar on the ground, and began to put it around her neck to serve as a reminder to herself in the future of how everything happened. Her friend had been a controlling person who ruined her life, and up until the very end.. She listened to their every word, like a puppet. But she’ll remember this time, she had to remember everything that happened. When she finds her old friend, she would make this damn collar that they had given her. Her revenge would be as sweet as the blood she would drink for years to come.After sleeping for a hundred years or so, she woke up from her old coffin to find herself in the modern days. After breaking into an apartment of a younger girl for her blood, she discovers a black box that lights up! The online world is now within grasp! And after some research, it seems like the perfect way to find her old rival...","icon":"biscuoot.png"}

An angel going by Gabriel taught Ancora how to survive in the continuity, using threads of fate to control the world around him.Sometime after coming to the continuity, Ancora found a library he had never seen before. Inside the endless library, books writing themselves full of the stories of living people. Inside one of the books, he found the story of Gabriel. He learned why he had been brought back from the dead; to act as a host for a dying god Gabriel served.When Gabriel found Ancora reading through the library, the ensuing argument led into an intense fight resulting in Ancora ripping away a small halo from Gabriel’s head, revealing a monstrous form hidden by holy magic. After stabbing Gabriel with a shard of his own halo, Ancora was able to seal him inside the continuity.Some time later, Ancora learned what Gabriel really was; an amalgamation forcibly fusing three brothers together. Gabriel was only the youngest brother, with Raphael and Michael unwillingly bound to him. Now, on top of searching for ways to help those across the multiverse, he’s looking for a way to free Raphael and Michael from Gabriel’s grasp.","icon":"ancora-jay.jpeg"}

They each pieced a fragment of themselves together, and in doing to, brought forth a new being- a new life.

Even as they opposed one another, their duty was too important to abandon over a simple skirmish, let alone to go sight-seeing on some planet. But Soul could explore solar systems they'd been watching over for billions of years, including one with the most advanced planet they'd ever seen: Earth. That being said, the humans didn't find Soul's pure form... particularly inviting. Just gazing upon it drove them completely insane. Soul needed to find a way to interact with people in a body humans loved. Then they found stuffed animals. Children cuddled them. Adults exchanged them as a sign of love and care. People of all ages collected them and kept them on their beds! It was the perfect body to inhabit! So Soul found a nice, big teddy bear sitting on a store shelf, climbed in, and waltzed out onto the streets... to become a STREAMER???","icon":"the-velvet-outlet.png"}

Although he loudly and repeatedly claims to be a dragon, he doesn't appear to look like one at all, rather resembling an amalgamation of many different animals.He is personable but intensely erratic, often reacting to stressful or scary situations with ear-splitting screeching, as well as performing on-stream stunts such as waxing his body hair and even electrocuting his testicles. He is also self-important and boastful to the point of utter delusion, claiming (sarcastically) on various occasions to be a member of Hololive, Nijisanji, Tsunderia, and VShojo all at the same time, and additionally claiming to have conquered all of mainland China, seemingly in retaliation for certain Chinese fans' mistreatment of Kiryu Coco.His favorite game to play is Path of Exile.A vaguely humanoid creature who first appeared around 79 A.D., in conjunction with the calamitous eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Although almost nothing is directly known about his origins, there have been many literary and artistic depictions of him through the ages, all of which either seem to be negative or rooted in extreme confusion. In the present, Scoria claims to be a contractor with the government, tasked with preventing Vesuvius from erupting once more and coating the world in ash, although he seems to spend practically all his time playing video games...","icon":"scoria.jpeg"}
{"pc":"p879-c3","name":"D.J. Crotch Sweat","languages":["English"],"genres":["Anime","Art","Chatting","Gaming","Horror","Manga","Mature","Music"],"description":"A Virtual Streamer who makes content in English.Jordan (DJ Crotch Sweat) is a nasty ugly human who I had to take over the body of so that I could exist in this dimensional plane. Apparently most people on this planet are not thrilled with Cephalopods who can speak and defy gravity. Also there is the Cheetos thing and the Red Bull truck I stole.You know when you spend as much power as I did to rip a hole in the fabric of reality, you would think the universe would be kind enough to deposit me in the head of a sentient human that was at least from this 4th dimensional space. What did I get instead? Some Punk Rocker that happened to be sleeping it off in a puddle of his own vomit in the Bronx 1981. I did like the haircut but still. Thus why I had him submit to the process of becoming digital. His skull was getting cramped. At least this way I can easily correct the mistakes he made originally. Oh well, stranger things have happened.BTW, how do you people reasonably exist with only 4 appendages? Walking bipedal? Do you people have a death wish or something?Meh.Halloween, 1938, Grover's Mill. A transmission from the great Orson Welles reports that the Martians have invaded the Earth. Then as quickly as it began and with huge gaping plot holes torn into the history of man kind I might add, the invasion stopped. Yeah. Not really. You have no idea how many people that we had to Mind-Wipe after that whole debacle. The people of 1938 and more to the point, New Jersey, were not ready for the concept of a group of interdimensional creatures accidentally blasting their way into this dimension.Technically we were attempting to tear a hole in reality but only insomuch as we could go get a decent burger. There is this place in Libby, Montana that makes the best.........never mind.So, myself, Tim, Jeff, Tiny and a handful of others (more to the point, the Seven Hyper-Intellects of the Multiverse) ended up in New Jersey. Ugh. If you thought Jersey Shore in this era was bad, you should see it in 2046. Entire planets have been depopulated by that show. Thankfully time is much easier to transverse than the higher level dimensions so we traveled back before humanity was a thing and moved to Nampa, Idaho which at that time was known as the \"Dirt of Ug\". You would be surprised at how easily dinosaurs take to being used as pack mules to haul the ship to the other side of the continent. You are all going to be sooooo pissed off when you find out how much of history isn't like you were taught.Oh and BTW God looks and sounds just like Sean Connery from Zardoz. Also his name is Bob. I am not so sure I would go so far as to call him God though. Whatever floats your boat though. We all have to have a.......Okay back to the plot.I will have to write a book about that later. Something akin to Little House On The Prairie but with more colorful language, Beer and less innocent douche-baggery.  The multiverse is so much more fluid than your tiny human minds give it credit for. Everything that is done, thought about or generally has some probability of being a thing has a place in this big bad plasticized Zip-Lock baggy we call the.....Universe, Multiverse, Newark, whatever. So many names...... I have come to calling it the Dumpster Fire of the Stars.Anyway, after centuries of trials and tribulations on this worthless Dirt-Ball we we ended up with me being the only one of the Hyper-Intellects left in this time/space. So really at that point I became the CEO of this endeavor that is now called Merciless Radio. I would tell you the original name of this place but I seem to remember something about keeping this kid friendly. You all need to give kids more credit.Of course, I had to repopulate the station with who I could after the great incident with DJ Sexbot. Thankfully a few AIs, some of the cloning material we kept in tubes, the Great Multiversal Omnibus and the will to survive and dominate, we hopped on a freight train bound for Alaska and from there Pipyat in the Ukraine. You people are retardedly afraid of radiation I have to say. I mean who wouldn't want extra parts?BTW, who would have ever thought someone with a name like Sexbot would have been a Chaos Daemon? Live and learn right? Next thing you will tell me is that Beer is the tool of Satan. Meh, I refuse to think about it.So from there I ordered a Pirate Radio Ship from Planet Yarrrr and we started over. We now hover 56 Kilometers above the earth with the cloaking device in constant on. Well sometimes we like turning it off for about a minute or so. Gives the armed forces of Russia and China a heart attack. I also like dropping lead weights on the cities below us just to see what happens on occasion.So, Ill have to give you all a tour sometime. And with all of that I would like to say thanks for stopping in. Also give us your money or we will disintegrate your frontal lobe. Lets see how you do in real life with no bladder control eh?PS: What is all of this about Genre? We have to choose? BTW, we don't do Woke. I am allergic to human stupidity. No seriously, I break out into huge boils. I have to drink heavily for about a week to get them to go away.I suppose if you all have to ask, we like the esoteric and the chaotic. For example, I think every 5 year old little girl should own a Barret M92 .50 Caliber Sniper Rifle. Its adorable. I think global dominance and Vocaloid belong together. I think that Dorohedoro and FLCL (old version) should be the template that we base all societal norms on. You all will get to know me over time.No really. I am beaming the information subliminally into all of your minds. Give it time.-- Jordan Doe (DJ Crotch Sweat: Disc Jockey / CEO Merciless Radio)","icon":"d-j-crotch-sweat.jpeg"}

She seeks to bring joy to others and create a space where others feel comfortable being themselves.Coming from an alternate reality, Verena is a bobcat girl with dendromancer powers, which is an elaborate way to say that she’s a witch with plant powers, both manipulating and divination based. One day in her home world she decided to experiment with a taboo of her reality; creating a portal to cross into another. Her world had knowledge of other realities, but the attempt to wander into them was strictly forbidden. However, Verena grew bored of her fortune-telling by day, assassination by night, jobs and knew it was time for a change that only could be achieved by breaking such a rule. So using a mirror-portal method based on theoretical research she once stumbled upon, she was able to succeed in traveling into our reality. However, the one thing she didn’t account for was the portal being a one way crossing. So for now, she’s stuck here. Verena sought out her human doppel, her worlds term for her alternate self, and now she lives with her other self, who works to support the both of them while Verena stays home streaming and lurking on the internet.","icon":"verena-lunebrite.jpeg"}

He is green, fuzzy and has one big eye. He attempts to keep his channel family friendly but that doesn't always work out, not due to him, but due to the people he collaborates with. He is very friendly and seems to enjoy sweets.Around 210 earth years ago, Fuzzy coconuts was awakened from a spore.He is of the Race Fauxconut (termed that way on earth due to their appearance resembling a coconut shell from behind when they get on in years.) he may be 210 earth years old, but compared to the lifespan of a human he is somewhere between 18 and 21.Fauxconuts do not have the concept of sex or gender on their planet. they reproduce in groups of 5-7, releasing around 500 spores each onto the side of trees on their planet (it resembles moss) most spores don't survive, however  the ones that do are later split and claimed by their parents to raise alone. Usually the parent each get one or two children to raise. in this case Fuzzy has a sibling.again, gender is a foreign concept to fuzzy. they identify as a male, but they have been known to cross-dress. not as a symbol saying \"boys can do this too\" but more as a confused creature that doesn't understand the culture of the planet they are on 100%. Not saying they don't believe anyone can be whoever they want, they just are a tad confused which adds to their charm.20 years ago, Fuzzy's family of 3 went to earth as tourists on a vacation away from home. when they arrived they quickly realized that they would not be accepted publicly and was told by the government that if they want to be here they must lie low. Since then (after countless negotiations), the government has decided to be a little less strict. they still cant go out into public, but they may go on the internet as a digital representation of themselves. Fuzzy jumped on the opportunity and opened up TheFuzzclops channel.Fuzzy's race (the Fauxconut) have telepathy (being able to talk amongst themselves via their mind) however, humans don't have minds capable of such, so Fuzzy uses a little speaker to communicate with humans if he ever needs to.Fuzzy doesn't exactly have appendages, but he does move around using telekinesis on himself.Fuzzy is often seen floating in a bubble. this bubble is comprised of mucus that his mouth excretes. the mucus is made out of access nutrients that his body doesn't need at the given moment. Its quite temperature regulated and can withstand outside forces of roughly 14 tons.Fauxconuts are based in both plant an animal anatomy. They are very unique in that sense. They both eat things and absorb sunlight to collect their daily dose of energy. However, if they eat too much, the nutrients just leaks out of their mouth in a form of mucus that they can ingest later.His mouth works similar to a venous fly trap in the sense that it encloses around his prey, and fills up with enzymes to break it down. He does always try to mercy kill what he is eating before he puts it in his mouth, but its hard for him to tell when the small animals play dead. It actually takes time to start digestion however.When Fauxconuts eat sweets or junk food they turn into mucus as well but with a different color.After an unspecified amount of time, Fuzzy will grow old and turn brown like all Fauxconuts. This is actually the process of turning into a seed that will eventually be planted on his Homeworld. he will then turn into a Astral Ent roughly the size of a redwood. though it is unlikley that you will ever witness that because it takes human lifetimes to even become a seed let alone grow into a tree.","icon":"the-fuzzclops.png"}

She was created in a lab, 300 light years from Earth as part of a secretive experiment by an alien military organization.\nThe experiment involved extracting DNA of select species from multiple planets and fusing their genetics to make loyal soldiers.\nNyota's unit happened to contain DNA from canines of the planet Earth as the aliens found their loyalty to be a beneficial trait for military application.In being an experimental soldier, Nyota has multiple abilities coded into her DNA that have been honed in with rigorous training.\nA natural fighter with strength at the forefront of design and engineered to have a heightened sense of both smell and hearing, these can sometimes be detrimental in tense situations. Her weapon of choice is a ray gun developed by the same alien military organization that constructed Nyota.As is the case with the rest of her squadron, her prime directive was to travel to Earth and hold their civilizations hostage, so that her squadrons' alien overlords could \"finish the job\" as it were, and create a successful outpost built upon human enslavement.Upon being sent out with her squadron to Earth in multiple ships, the squadron encountered an organic anomaly. A camouflaged creature of no planetary origin began attacking her entire unit. Her training buddies, her closest friends, were all gone in a matter of minutes. Their ships have yet to be located, seemingly vanishing out of thin space. Not knowing the status of their lives, she made the executive decision to continue carrying out the mission.\nHer ship was heavily damaged, but still contained the amount of power needed to warp to her intended destination.\nThe warp was successful and she ended up in the solar system familiar to you and I; home to planet Earth.Nyota persevered for her friends, compelled to complete the mission intended for her from inception.\nUpon approaching Earth she decided to embark on a reconnaissance mission to travel the world and educate herself about human civilization from Australia to Azerbaijan, Peru to Poland, and everything in between.Nyota was to complete this reconnaissance mission over the course of 20 years. In the process of which, she learned how the various governments and military organizations operated around the globe.\nShe immersed herself in the many cultures of Earth from their cuisine to their arts, to their primitive technology, hoping to use this knowledge to manipulate humanity for her mission purposes.During this long period of time, multiple attempts were made by Nyota to contact home to update them on the mission status, however responses from mission control mysteriously ceased after the 5th year, leaving a clueless Nyota stranded alone in her mission.\nThis put no damper in Nyota's enthusiasm to complete her sworn objectives, remaining a loyal minion to her alien overlords at first.Over the past 10 years however, this enthusiasm has been curbed due to radio silence from home, causing Nyota to start giving up on the mission. She slowly started to fall in love with everything Earth had to offer, and started regularly enjoying the Terran past times of video games, painting, and drinking. She would also occasionally travel to neighboring solar systems, exploring foreign planets of varying landscapes and climates.\nShe would always return to Earth, however, as she had begun to consider this once strange planet her new homeNow, with this newfound enamor for Earth, her prime directive has changed from enslaving Earth to protecting it.","icon":"nyota-inu.png"}

She was a bright streak in the sky, flaming fury of a God's wrath around her before her judgment call was made known on all the wind. They say that only a single Floram ventured out to hear the call -an Elder of Elders, touched by the Green Mother above- to find what was to be done to appease the Sister, and quell her fire spread. What she found, however, was no Sister in angered cry, no Deity. Nothing, but a rose, small and weak, covered in red chlora.Our Lady, wise and kind, took the frail rose into her care deep within the Sepal woods. It is said, that as time passed and wounds healed, a love bloomed between the two. And a new being bearing the name of the rose and her Hand, would come into being from their love. Unfortunately, a Harvest of rot would come for her. And then for all of the Green Mother's children if not stopped.This is the last history passed down of the Floram, the farthest in time gifted as a glimpse by the Green Mother herself. And so these things are known. That all things must wilt and wither. That the Herald will be born. That rot will enter the world. The Elders know this well.They only pray that the end is not yet near.That, although herald, that she may be strong enough to contain it. To oppose it.Whoever she may be.","icon":"nphaea.jpeg"}

They mainly play videogames, watch videos and hangout. Their backstory can soon be read on their other social media platforms.Her favourite Videogame is league of legends, somehow. She wonders how she can enjoy the game so much.Zu'ra was once a normal little girl with loving parents, without powers and in a normal school. On one gloomy day, the newspapers arrive, revealing that a group of kids from the ages 6 to 12 have been abducted by an anonymous group. One child from that group was the unfortunate Zu'ra Kazuna.After a few years with no sign of the missing children, the town gave up and mourned for the lost children.\nDuring these years, the children endured harsh trials; Zu'ra and 6 other kids from the 20 got through those trials. Each of the 6 children got incubated in their containers, slowly mutating into machines with their own unique powers, used for experiments and missions, hidden away from society.The students who were once small children are now full grown adults/young adults, trained to serve the secret organisation, with each having their experiment number tattooed somewhere on their body.\nZu'ra is one of their top assassins with the power of controling any liquids (Her main element, water and her least used, blood.)\nThough she's the symbol of their assassins, she is one of the only experiments containing just a sparkle of human emotions and thoughts. Zu'ras appearance has changed a lot throughout the years without sunlight and the constant experiments with DNA and toxins.\nThe once rozy cheeked bubbly girl with rich brown hair, warm hazel eyes and warm undertoned white skin, turned into a woman with  pure white hair with a blue horn poking through, cold white skin with no marks and icy eyes. There was one thing she chose to change about herself; her tattoos. She chose to have tattoos on her abdomen, upperarms and shoulders, so she could feel like she had more control over her monstrous appearance and make it more like she wanted.The experiments are held in class X in the college of heroic futures, but the class is unknown to everyone except the heads of the school that are linked to the organisation.\nZu'ra among a few others of the class get more and more curious as to what is outside of their locked down area, since they may never see how they got out to go on their missions.\nOne day, when Zu'ra went on her training to control big pools of water, she caught a glimpse of a young male in his dorm window whenever she woke up from her narcose, but quick after got knocked out by the guards transfering her back.Once Zu'ra was brought to her room, she sketched the face of the male she remembered from her training and looked at it all night, wondering  why she wasn't allowed out at any time, or talk to anyone outside of class X or the professors.\nShe then found her new obsession: 'Find who the male she saw was and find out why she may never go outside of the locked area.'","icon":"zura-kazuna.png"}

They especially enjoy short indie titles and open-world exploration. They have plans to try more genres soon.Being a plant, human notions of gender do not apply to Shandley. They will accept English pronouns they/them, it/its, or fleur/fleurs/fleurself.Shandley is a European mandrake (Mandragora officinarum). Their appearance changes with the seasons. Shandley will grow flowers in spring, have fewer leaves in summer, have berries in autumn and have only leaves in winter. Their total height also varies slightly with the seasons, but they are approximately 40cm (16 inches) tall including the terracotta pot they usually reside in.Because plants do not use calendars, Shandley's age and birthdate are unknown.Shandley is a mandrake who grew up in a colony of other mandrakes. They spent their very early years fascinated by the humans who lived nearby and tended to the plants in the valley. The other mandrakes did not approve of Shandley's interest in people and would often scold and shame Shandley, trying to get the young mandrake to behave more like the rest of the colony. Eventually, the humans became older and passed away, leaving the house and valley abandoned. Shandley grew older and realized that they felt starved of the human attention and care they had become accustomed to as a seedling. Shandley would often sneak away at night to observe humans in nearby homes, to the admonishment of the other mandrakes. Eternally stubborn, Shandley would only keep disobeying. Through watching humans, they were eventually able to speak and understand English somewhat fluently.One day, a heavy storm caused a flash flood that threatened the valley. Shandley knew enough English to understand the flood warning that sounded, but the other plants didn't believe them when they tried to warn the colony. The colony tried to forcibly make Shandley stay put and accept whatever fate the rain would bring, as their ancestors had always done. Fearing death, Shandley uprooted themself and let the water carry them away as they watched the other mandrakes be ripped apart by the tide.Weak and injured from the ordeal, Shandley woke up next to a misplaced cellphone that was playing an unnamed VTuber's stream. The kind voice made Shandley feel more relaxed. The owner of the phone appeared and was surprised to meet a talking plant. The Human nursed Shandley back to health and the two have been friends ever since.Shandley noticed how much joy and comfort VTubers brought to both themself and to their new human friend. Shandley decided that they wanted everyone to experience that kind of happiness, and that the best way to do this is to become a streamer too. After many typing lessons and lots of English practice, Shandley is ready to make friends with all the humans!LIKESDISLIKESMISC TRIVIA","icon":"shandley-mandre.png"}

She works mostly works on healing spells. She loves animals especially reptiles and also loves to make friends. P.S her favorite color is purpleA little witch growing up with a family of witch’s. A loving mother and father who is a warlock. I also have some siblings. Gina the oldest, Tabitha the middle and Xeno the youngest brother.We went out into the fields to practice. My father and mother were watching from afar. We had a fake goblin far away to practice on. Gina heads first and used slow to slow down the enemy. “Good good!” Says my father while clamping his hands. “Pfft, that was nothing!” Tabitha scarfed. “Watch this!” She yells she then casted confusion. “Thats wonderful Tabitha!” My mother shouts.Now.. It’s my turn.. I have a hard time doing spells because I just can’t get it right. Every time  I think about it I freeze. “**” We’re waiting!” Yells my father. My siblings start to snicker and I can hear them “You know she can’t do it. She can’t do anything right. All she can do is make people around her cry because her magic sticks”Me hearing my siblings speak of me in this sort of matter is not acceptable. This is heart wrenching I’ll show them. I’ll show them all! I raise my wooden want and cast a spell but it was not a healing spell but a summoning spell. I’ve summoned a lil goo gecko. It was a purplish color. I poked it and it started to take a liking to me. Then I turn to everyone and said “See! I can do it!” My siblings are at a shock. Then I see what they’re shocked at... My father.. He was not amused about me summoning at a young age.My father came towards me and demanded on where I learned that spell. I told him that it just happened. He screamed saying how dangerous it was to summon creatures. At this point I’m crying because I did something good. But my father is just telling me I’m nothing. My mother stepped in and told my father that he’s out of line. “Why are you yelling at her!? She summoned a cute creature and you’re yelling at her for it!?”My mother then turns to my mother and yells “Do you want the humans to find out!? Do you want them to find out that live here!?” My mother replies “Not all humans are bad dear!” My father looks away from my mother and looks and the goo gecko. “Well, What are we going to do with you” I run and grab the gecko “Father I summoned it I should be able to keep it!” As tears roll down my eyesMy father looked at me and yells “FINE!” On our way back home the siblings wouldn’t leave me and my pet alone. I think it was out of jealousy. But it still hurt. As soon as we got home I ran into my room and slammed the door. I was sobbing non-stop. The little slime gecko went under my bed and stayed there to rest.I hear a knock on my door. “‘May I come in?” My mother asked softly. My mother then entered the room and close the door behind here and sat at the edge of the bed. “Dear, I know today was a rough one. Please don’t let this bother you. You know your father is trying to protect you.” She says softlyI softly yell “I don’t know why he keeps teaching us these same things. I just want to learn more! I know there’s more out there and I want to learn that!” I start crying at this point. My mother starts petting my back “Dear, you’re a growing up to fast. Your siblings will be going on adventures you just to wait a bit longer.”“But what if I mess up?” I say as I cry. “What if I keep messing up and I won’t be able to go on adventures!? I’ll just fail and bring everyone down!”. “Stop that right now” my mother says with a stern voice. “You do not think of yourself this way”. “What you did today was amazing and someone your age wouldn’t be able to summon a creature.” You’re a wonder witch and don’t let others tell you otherwise.I look at my mother and whipped away my tears. I gave my mother a big hug and she hugged me back. “You know, you have the same heart mark under your cheek like me.” She says. “What dose it mean momma?” I asked. My mother replies in a soft voice “It means that you have a great love for the living. And the love to help others. One day you’ll become a great witch” my mother says softly.I look into my mothers eyes and start crying and then held my mother for a hug. “My dear, why are you crying??” She asks. “I’m going to become the best healing witch! No, I’ll be the best! I promise!” My mother held back and whispered “I know darling. I know.As the mother and daughter hug the lil goo gecko comes out “Oh gez! I forgot to name you!” The gecko hops on the bed and lays on my leg. “I’m going to name your Gooby!” My mother chuckled.YEARS AND YEARS LATERHello, I’m Twinklepistol I’m a with who always on a mission to find new things and learn about them!

At this age of his existence he was captured and held captive by his kidnappers... His captors forced fed him a fruit that is considered forbidden in his world. This fruit was named “Eindwel”... (indwell)Eindwel was a putrid smelling fruit with a lingering miasma,  it made anyone who eats it vulnerable of being controlled beyond their will, the consumer felt euphoria and high creative expression temporarily but in exchange for 30 years of your life each time you eat it.His captors forced Joon to create very convoluted art. For each specific ruler on the prison like grounds, captors had the power to send themselves into any art they wanted but they must spill a drop of blood onto the art or painting , claiming it and making it their own escape or simulated experience. So with this, his captors were obsessed because entering an artifact with very complex auras or detail was like a drug. Joon was the only artist to ever be able to surmount the ruler’s immensely high expectations.The rulers of the captive grounds had Joon create 32 artifacts and eat 32 Eindwel within the time frame of a week... before one night he managed to get away. All the rulers had “escaped” into Joons creations for them and while oblivious , he took his chance to leave but his old body made it difficult though successful.He escaped the captivity and returned to his parents but upon his return he discovered that his parents gave him away for fortune promised by his captors.They saw his old aged body in disgust and threw him out of their new golden pyramid palace of a home. Shouting that they have all they need now thanks to his mind giving him over to be a slave and the fortune it brought upon them.Crushed by this realization... he felt utterly defeated...driven to insanity... The ancient artist begged the creator of his universe to be taken away from his misery he wanted a new soul... His aged and brittle body was very weak and almost useless from the Eindwel, Joon just wanted to cleanse his body from all the things he has been through, in hopes of washing away his sorrows...Joon discovered a waterfall on his parent’s land behind their palace.He thought maybe he should just go there, shower and cleanse himself and to rest forever as he felt like his time has come.the creator of his universe blessed him with “Another Chance”.\nHe was given a new unique youthful appearance and new “life” but he could not be given a new experience or mental state of all the sorrow that has happened to him in his past life...Joon was sent to another universe, through “ ˈbo͞oməˌraNG  ˈnebyələ “ a mist light years away to reach a new destination. This action was sort of a curse/blessing due to passing through the nebula, it froze all old memories of his past and he is stuck with them. This will forever dwell on his mind unless there is a “Kyooer” created in the future.Joon suffers from night terrors, fatigue, flashbacks and crippling depression, anxiety almost like agoraphobia / PTSD, migraines, he calls them “Sephirothing” from his past experiences, currently but he uses his hobbies and interests in hopes to get his mind off of it all.Although Joon looks very young he is actually 990 years old. He’s set out in search of a community thats welcoming and shares similar interests , even if they don’t have similarities, he’d like to discover and be introduced to things. As he has an inquisitive mind.It takes Joon a lot of effort and a little while to open up and get to know people but once that shell or wall is broken down and trust or he feels more comfy, he’s very funny and helpful to anyone in need as much as he can be.","icon":"joon-mainingredients.jpeg"}

{"pc":"p955-c4","name":"KVAZAR","languages":["Russian"],"genres":["Anime","Art","Chatting","Gaming","Horror","Manga"],"description":"KVAZAR is a male Virtual YouTuber who makes content in Russian.Шёл 1931 год, 13 летний я вышел из дома просто прогуляться, друзей у меня не было, да и не хотел я ни с кем общаться, пройдя от дома метров 200 я увидел высокого мужчину в длинном пальто, я не обратил на него особого внимания. А вот он сделал как раз наоборот. Спустя несколько секунд я почувствовал что он схватил меня за воротник, я попытался вырваться но уже в эту секунду мне в левый глаз прилетел удар ножом и пришёлся чуть-ли не до корней волос, от боли и паники я начал активно размахивать руками и попал мужчине в кадык, после чего я почувствовал резкую боль в спине и в глазах потемнело.Открыл глаза я уже не в том мире который привык видеть, в нем было очень ярко и вокруг было много жёлтого.\nЯ видел перед собой огромный глаз с множеством крыльев, он сказал мне что все хорошо, после чего начал улетать. Место вокруг было похоже на город.Спустя пару минут преследования я увидел уже не ту фигуру, а человека в белом костюме, золотыми волосами и светящимися желтыми глазами, он подошёл ко мне и сказал что мне есть куда идти. Я лишь помотал головой, он вздохнул и повел меня за собой. Коснувшись его руки я сразу узнал его имя.\nЕго звали Даниил и он Ангел, а я нахожусь в раю. Он понял что я тоже хочу стать таким. Он сказал что раньше никогда такого не делали. Даже не пытались. Но он готов попробовать принять человека в ряды ангелов. Я же был ребенком, чистым в глазах ангела.Другие ангелы были против его идеи, но он ее реализовал.\nОн посвятил меня в ангелы, как оказалось он действительно может это сделать, у меня появились за спиной крылья, они выглядели странно, словно два позвоночника держали рыбьи ребра, которые в свою очередь держали перья.Шло время, я учился всему у Даниила, но другим ангелам не нравился \"не перворожденный\"\nОни распускали обо мне слухи и гадости, на этом моменте мой мир фантазий схлопнулся\nМои представления о святых существах начали сильно меняться, когда их действия начали походить на цирк... Я не выдержал, их было четверо, и их четверых позже не стало, я лично начал заканчивать их \"карьеры\" по одному.После первого началось действие скверны, моя кровь и слезы стали густыми как гной и чёрными как уголь, мои капилляры в глазах не выдержали и лопнули, глаза в свою очередь начали гнить пока не пропали вовсе, проводив второго в небытие, моя кожа начала походить на синтетику и лишилась пигментации полностьюМой нимб почернел и рассыпался углем мне на голову, а крылья последовали примеру нимба...\nубив третьего с моими органами стало происходить то что было с глазами, я начал выхаркивать \"гной\" а органы гнить пока не оставили пустую оболочку, я стал походить на манекен с чернеющей пустотой внутри, при \"прощании\" с четвертым, я уже даже близко не был похож на одного из них, я был черно-бел с двумя блестящими точками в пустых глазницах которые сияют даже в самой кромешной тьме, мои зубы были похожи на акульи, а губы и щеки рвались, ведь не могли полностью выражать мою улыбку.Сама тьма шила мне одежду стараясь скрыть как можно больше частей моего тела от людских глаз. А мне это только нравилось, мои руки скрывали черные перчатки. Возле ног закрытых чёрными брюками развевалось словно парус мое пальто, того же цвета. Под ней же была рубашка.\nУбив четвёртого ангела я потерял связь с окружением...\nСнова в другом месте, куда пускают только монстров, я сам создал себе свою \"темную комнату\". Но мне не нравилась тишина, тьма создала мне кучу старых телевизоров, но ловить каналы они не собирались. Ничего кроме белого шума я не видел, но меня это вполне устраивало, он стал частью меня.Встав после отдыха который длился года, но прошел для меня в секунды, я понял, Мне есть куда вернуться и что делать, уже наступило хорошее для этого время...","icon":"kvazar.jpeg"}
